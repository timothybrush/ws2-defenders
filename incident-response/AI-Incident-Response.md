# 1. Overview

## 1.1. Abstract

This paper addresses the topic of incident response in the context of AI systems. As with other materials produced by the Coalition for Secure AI, this paper focuses on technological capabilities and gaps that are specific to the field of artificial intelligence and does not address the topic of incident response in other contexts as this has been well-researched and documented by existing frameworks (such as [NIST Incident Response Recommendations and Considerations for Cybersecurity Risk Management](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r3.pdf)). This paper guides defenders on proactively minimizing the impact of  AI system exploitation. It details how to maintain auditability, resiliency, and rapid recovery even when a system is compromised by advanced threat actors. The guide also explores the unique challenges of AI incident response, emphasizing the role of forensic investigation and the complications introduced by agentic architectures, while providing concrete steps to manage this new complexity. 

## 1.2. How To Use This Document

### 1.2.1. Quick Start Guide

The incident response life cycle has several versions from varying sources. For the purposes of this paper we will focus on NIST 800-61r3’s life cycle phases and provide a mapping to the closest [SANS PICERL](https://www.sans.org/media/score/504-incident-response-cycle.pdf) phases as a reference. 

| **NIST SP 800-61 rev 3 lifecycle phase** | **Closest SANS PICERL phase(s)** | **AI relevance** |
|---|---|---|
| **Govern (GV)** | Preparation | Set AI-specific policy and roles: e.g., who may push new model weights to production, required update cadence for model cards, and breach-disclosure windows for LLM supply-chain compromises. |
| **Identify (ID)** | Preparation | Maintain inventories of datasets, model artefacts, prompts, and dependencies; perform AI-threat risk assessments (model-exfiltration, data-poisoning, jailbreaks) and maintain model card library. |
| **Protect (PR)** | Preparation | Apply safeguards: encrypt checkpoints, enforce least-privilege on inference APIs, implement input-validation/output-filtering guardrails, and add watermarking to deter prompt-injection abuse. |
| **Detect (DE)** | Identification | Ensure proper Monitoring and Telemetry |
| **Respond (RS)** | Containment & Eradication | Contain (hot-swap to safe snapshots, throttle APIs, revoke leaked keys), eradicate root causes, and coordinate disclosure to affected users. |
| **Recover (RC)** | Recovery | Recreate or retrain from trusted baselines, run robustness/bias test suites, and validate checkpoints against performance and fairness thresholds before full go-live. |
| **Identify.IM – Improvement** | Lessons Learned | Feed incident artefacts into future Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) or adversarial-training cycles and relevant monitor tools, SIEMs, etc., update threat models and playbooks, share anonymized TTPs |

## 1.3. Executive Summary

The increasing integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) into business processes presents a new frontier of risks. AI systems, with their inherent complexity and autonomy, can have significant consequences, ranging from reputational damage and financial loss to legal and ethical liabilities. To navigate this evolving landscape, a specialized AI Incident Response Framework is a necessity. This document provides an executive summary of the AI Incident Response Framework developed by CoSAI, designed to equip security teams with the necessary capabilities to effectively manage AI-specific incidents. This framework provides a structured approach to preparing for, detecting, responding to, and learning from AI incidents, ensuring organizational resilience in the age of AI.

### 1.3.1 Types of AI Incidents
A shared taxonomy sharpens detection, triage, ownership, and playbook design.

#### A. Performance & Robustness Failures
- **Model Drift:** Accuracy or calibration declines as data distribution shifts.
- **Adversarial Evasion:** Crafted inputs bypass filters or controls.
- **Unexpected/Harmful Outputs:** Nonsensical, policy-violating, or unsafe generations.

#### B. Security Vulnerabilities (ML Pipeline & Model)
- **Data Poisoning:** Training data manipulation alters model behavior.
- **Model Inversion / Membership Inference:** Sensitive training data leakage via queries.
- **Model Theft / Extraction:** Unauthorized replication of proprietary models.

#### C. Ethics, Fairness & Bias Incidents
- **Algorithmic Bias:** Systematic disparate impacts across protected classes.
- **Opacity / Lack of Explainability:** Decisions cannot be justified in regulated contexts.
- **Unintended Social Consequences:** Downstream harm to users or society.

#### D. Misuse & Abuse
- **Deepfakes/Disinformation:** Synthetic media for fraud or manipulation.
- **AI-Assisted Attacks:** AI leveraged to scale phishing, malware, and fraud.


### 1.3.2 AI Incident Response Plan
Adapts the traditional incident response lifecycle to the specific challenges of AI. It provides a structured, repeatable process to ensure timely and effective management of AI incidents. The plan is organized into five key phases:

#### 1. Preparation
- Complete production model inventory (owners, data, risks, criticality).
- Define AI-IR roles, authorities, and decision thresholds.
- Maintain AI-specific playbooks (bias, drift, adversarial, data leakage).
- Run training & simulations (tabletops, red/blue prompt exercises).

#### 2. Detection & Analysis
- Monitor performance, safety, fairness, and security signals (e.g., drift stats, toxicity, jailbreak patterns, data exfiltration indicators).
- Enable intake channels (internal reports, user complaints, vendor alerts).
- Triage by severity, blast radius, regulatory exposure, and patient/customer impact.

#### 3. Containment
- Disable tools or rollback to prior model; gate high-risk features.
- Isolate systems; rate-limit or block malicious inputs.
- Activate temporary guardrails (stricter content filters, human-in-the-loop).

#### 4. Eradication & Recovery
- Root cause analysis (data, model, infra, policy).
- Retrain/patch models; cleanse data; rotate keys/tokens.
- Validate performance, safety, and compliance before redeploy.

#### 5. Post-Incident Activities
- Blameless post-mortem, timeline, and effectiveness review.
- Action items with owners and deadlines; update playbooks, policies, and training.
- Feed lessons into ML governance, risk registers, and CI/CD controls.


### 1.3.3 Key Roles & RACI
Clear accountability avoids delay and rework. Example matrix below; tailor to your org.

| Activity | Incident Commander | AI/ML Engineer | Legal & Compliance | Communications |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Declare Incident** | A | R | I | I |
| **Technical Investigation** | C | A/R | I | I |
| **Take Model Offline** | A | R | C | I |
| **External Communications** | C | I | A | R |
| **Post-Mortem Report** | A | R | C | C |

**Legend:** `R` = Responsible, `A` = Accountable, `C` = Consulted, `I` = Informed.


### 1.3.4 Incident Response Playbooks
Playbooks translate policy into actionable detections. Each should include the following structure:

- **Incident Type:** A clear description of the specific AI incident the playbook addresses.
- **Detection:** How to identify that this type of incident is occurring, including specific monitoring alerts and reporting channels.
- **Triage and Severity:** Criteria for assessing the severity of the incident and the key stakeholders to notify.
- **Containment Steps:** A checklist of immediate actions to take to contain the incident.
- **Eradication and Recovery Procedures:** Detailed technical steps for resolving the issue and restoring the system.
- **Communication Plan:** Pre-approved communication templates for internal and external stakeholders.

##### Some example playbooks:
- Adversarial Evasion (Prompt/Content Bypass)
- Model/Data Exfiltration or Leakage

### 1.3.5 Key Lessons Learned
- Run blameless post-mortems within SLA; capture timeline, root causes, and control gaps.
- Produce measurable actions (owners, deadlines) and track to closure.
- Instrument governance: add fairness/safety KPIs to production SLOs; expand telemetry (prompt logs, content filters, tooling traces); integrate security scanning for AI/ML in CI/CD.
- Prevent recurrences: clarify authority to disable/rollback; expand adversarial testing; standardize fallback modes and comms templates.

# 3. Creating an AI Incident Response Plan

The **core objectives** of an AI Incident Response Plan are to:
- Minimize business and user impact during incidents
- Protect sensitive data from AI system exploitation
- Maintain regulatory compliance
- Preserve evidence for forensic analysis
- Identify root causes for prevention and response

## 3.1. Pre-Incident Preparation

| **Component** | **Key Elements** |
|---------------|------------------|
| **Risk Assessment** | • Secure AI system components and architecture<br>• Critical data assets processed by AI systems<br>• Potential attack vectors based on ATLAS framework<br>• Compliance requirements<br>• Business impact of potential compromise |

## 3.2. Monitoring and Telemetry

To protect AI systems from evolving threats, telemetry must capture a comprehensive set of signals spanning model inference behavior, prompt and output risks, content safety, and model integrity. This includes monitoring for prompt injection, output manipulation, knowledge base poisoning, model drift, unauthorized tool or API usage, and other adversarial activities. Tracking agent workflows, context exchanges, and system lifecycles provides visibility into misuse, operational anomalies, and attacks. This data enables organizations to safeguard AI pipelines, ensure compliance, and strengthen incident detection and response with traceable, structured observability data.

| **Telemetry Type**                    | **Purpose**                                                      | **Relevant Threats Detected**                                |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Model Inference Activity         | Tracks all inference executions including token usage, confidence, latency, and endpoints. | Abuse of model APIs, data exfiltration, inference abuse (e.g., model scraping). |
| Prompt Injection Detection       | Monitors input prompts for adversarial payloads or jailbreak attempts. | Prompt injection attacks, jailbreaking, prompt leakage.      |
| Content Risk Detection           | Assesses LLM output for toxicity, bias, PII leakage, and unsafe content generation. | Disinformation, output poisoning, PII/PHI leakage, model misuse. |
| Model Drift Detection            | Detects distributional shifts in model input/output indicative of adversarial manipulation or operational risk. | Data poisoning, concept drift, model degradation over time.   |
| Agentic Workflow Execution       | Logs multi-step decision-making by AI agents, including tool calls and retries. | Malicious tool chaining, unauthorized data access, misuse of plugins/APIs. |
| MCP (Model Context Protocol) Message Activity | Observes protocol-level context exchanges in agentic and retrieval-augmented systems. | Session hijacking, tampering with context/memory, unauthorized prompt modifications. |
| Agentic RAG Workflow Execution   | Captures the steps of retrieval-augmented generation pipelines including retrievers, LLMs, and validators. | Knowledge base poisoning, unsafe content retrieval, response manipulation. |
| AI Incident Finding              | Records confirmed or suspected incidents detected across AI systems (e.g., poisoning, unauthorized use, guardrail events). | Incident response triggers — prompt abuse, model misuse, security violations. |
| Tool Call Execution              | Logs API/tool calls made by agents, including argument inspection and error rates. | Unauthorized external access, misuse of internal or third-party APIs. |
| AI System Activity               | Lifecycle monitoring of AI systems: deployments, updates, shutdowns, failures. | Unauthorized model deployments, version tampering, system compromise. |

Effective security monitoring of AI systems requires capturing fine-grained telemetry at each of the input, processing, and output stages of AI workflows. Below are the some of the attributes essential for building threat detection use cases, anomaly detection, and incident response for AI-driven environments:

| **Attribute**           | **Explanation** |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `timestamp`            | Tracks the time of activity performed. Proper recording of time enables investigators to piece a timeline together especially when AI incidents span multiple services or layers. |
| `identity`            | Tracks the identity that performed an action. This could be a user or machine identity. |
| `prompt_text`            | Captures the raw input text or structured request sent to the AI model. Monitoring the `prompt_text` is crucial for detecting prompt injection attacks, data exfiltration attempts, or adversarial instructions that could manipulate model behavior. |
| `completion_text`        | Captures the model's output or response. It is essential to inspect `completion_text` for toxic content, bias, hallucinations, or leakage of sensitive information such as PII, credentials, or internal data. |
| `model_name/version`     | Logs the name and version of the model used. This ensures that only authorized and validated models are deployed and helps detect unauthorized model swapping or shadow AI deployments. |
| `token_usage`            | Measures the number of tokens in both input and output. Unusually high or low `token_usage` patterns can signal abusive scraping attempts or denial-of-service (DoS) behavior aimed at exhausting AI model resources. |
| `latency_ms`             | Measures the inference response time in milliseconds. Sudden spikes or drops in `latency_ms` may indicate resource exhaustion attacks, model misuse, or service degradation due to adversarial workloads. |
| `retrieved_docs`         | Tracks documents fetched during Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) workflows. It helps detect knowledge base poisoning, unauthorized document access, or retrieval manipulation that could compromise model outputs. |
| `tool_calls`             | Logs all external or internal tools invoked by AI agents. Monitoring `tool_calls` helps uncover unauthorized access to sensitive APIs, malicious tool chaining, or exfiltration via tool misuse during autonomous agent operations. |
| `confidence_score`       | Provides the model's confidence in its prediction or generation. Very low confidence scores can signal model uncertainty or adversarial influence, while unusually high confidence on manipulated inputs could reveal model evasion attempts. |
| `drift_metrics`          | Measures data drift or distribution changes in model inputs/outputs over time. Significant drift could indicate model poisoning, concept drift attacks, or environmental changes that degrade model performance or security. |
| `trace_id/session_id`    | Correlates activities across sessions and distributed systems. Proper tracking of `trace_id` and `session_id` enables forensic investigations, cross-system correlation, and incident scoping when AI incidents span multiple services or layers. |

#### 3.3.3.1. Forensics for AI Systems

In order to effectively conduct forensic analysis of security incidents on AI systems, the AI system should be able to record (and provide) sufficient amount of information for the investigator. For example, it is essential to be able to retrieve both system prompt and user prompts and any other parameters which were used when interacting with an AI model as well as the response from the system. In general AI model will not produce exactly the same outputs even given the same input and system prompt, therefore it is essential to preserve raw output details from the AI model in order to be able to reconstruct the whole picture of the incident.

AI systems can also interface and integrate with external functions and components (such as MCP servers). As with traditional security, accurate logging of these interactions and a log trail of external function executions should be preserved and made available to the forensic investigator.

User inputs may be used as a part of future training data for an AI system, therefore it is essential to be able to track user input inclusion and impact on training datasets. 

AI-based tools can also be used for effective analysis of forensic trails after an incident. However, similar to how traditional forensic tools can be attacked and exploited by malicious attacker - the investigator should be aware that AI-enabled analysis and forensic tools can also become a target of malicious activity. The risks of AI-based tool analysis should be evaluated based upon your organizations risk tolerances and mitigations should be leveraged including the use of sandboxed, isolated environments. 

Clearly, in this section we describe the expectations when there are no constraints. However, in real world AI system implementation resources can be finite and system constraints may impact the scope and scale of data preservation. As in traditional systems, the best practice is to identify data retention objectives at design time and to address resource constraints via data preservation techniques and data rotation during the implementation and deployment of AI system.

During analysts the investigator can ask the following questions:

* Were any of the guardrails successfully bypassed?
* Were any of the prompts intentionally modified by the attacker?
* Did the system produce unexpected and potentially harmful content?
* Did content include any sensitive information that could be potentially exfiltrated by an attacker?
* Did any other manipulation of data or system take place?

Finally, it is essential to understand and investigate the external components that were interacting with AI systems. Log trails of these components (such as web server logs, database query logs and so on) could also be extremely helpful in being able to reconstruct and understand the full picture of an AI security incident.

### 3.3.4. Post-Incident Activity Phase

| **Activity** | **Key Components** | **Implementation Guidance** |
|--------------|-------------------|----------------------------|
| **Lessons Learned** | **Post-Incident Review:** <br>• Timely meeting scheduling<br>• Cross-team representation<br>• Event timeline documentation<br>• Response effectiveness analysis<br><br> **Root Cause Analysis:** <br>• Underlying vulnerability investigation<br>• Determination of causation:<br> • Architectural design flaws<br> • Security control implementation errors<br> • Operational failures<br> • Novel attack techniques<br><br> **Response Evaluation:** <br>• Detection effectiveness assessment<br>• Containment strategy evaluation<br>• Recovery efficiency analysis<br>• Business impact measurement | • Schedule reviews within 1-2 weeks of resolution<br>• Focus on systemic improvements, not blame<br>• Document timeline from detection through resolution<br>• Identify gaps in tools, processes, and training<br>• Analyze whether incident resulted from known or novel techniques<br>• Measure response metrics against defined objectives |

## 3.4. Roles and Responsibilities

### 3.4.1. Provider vs. Consumer Responsibilities

A shared responsibility model between providers and consumers is essential to establish clear accountability and separation of duties in order to safeguard AI systems effectively. Providers—including base model developers, agent developers, and API hosts—should be responsible for ensuring foundational model robustness, implementing safety alignment, securing inference infrastructure, and embedding standardized guardrails. Consumers—comprising application developers and end organizations—must manage prompt and context control, application-level filtering, compliance monitoring, and incident detection.

### 3.4.2. Team Assessment and Training

| **Activity** | **Description** | **Implementation Guidance** |
|--------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| **Tabletop Exercises** | Scenario-based discussions using AI attack cases from [Section 2](#2-understanding-ai-security-incidents) | • Conduct quarterly exercises<br>• Rotate scenario types<br>• Include cross-functional teams<br>• Document lessons learned |
| **Technical Drills** | Hands-on exercises focused on specific AI incident response tasks | • Practice log analysis<br>• Test containment procedures<br>• Validate recovery processes<br>• Measure response times |
| **Cross-Functional Exercises** | Full-team simulations involving all relevant stakeholders | • Include business representatives<br>• Test communications channels<br>• Validate escalation procedures<br>• Practice regulatory notifications |
| **Adversarial Simulations** | Red-team exercises based on ATLAS techniques | • Simulate prompt injection attacks<br>• Test data poisoning scenarios<br>• Practice response to model extraction<br>• Evaluate detection capabilities |
| **Skills Assessment** | Regular evaluation of team knowledge and capabilities | • Identify training gaps<br>• Update learning materials<br>• Track improvement metrics<br>• Recognize high performers |

## 3.5. Communication and Collaboration

### 3.5.1. Regulatory Communication

Incident reporting has different requirements for different jurisdictions and industry verticals, manifold across levels of government.  In the US the [2022 CIRCIA legislation](https://www.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/2023-01/CIRCIA_07.21.2022_Factsheet_FINAL_508%20c.pdf) provided strict timelines for reporting cyber incidents to critical infrastructure segments even tighter than the financial industry's [GLBA](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/statutes/gramm-leach-bliley-act) for financial privacy requirements, while [HIPAA requires report of PHI breaches](https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/breach-notification/index.html) over longer timescales.  All 50 US states have their own breach notification laws.  In contrast, the EU is governed by [NIS2](https://www.nis-2-directive.com/NIS_2_Directive_Article_23.html) for critical infrastructure, [DORA](https://www.eiopa.europa.eu/digital-operational-resilience-act-dora_en) for financial institutions and [GDPR for personal data breaches](https://gdpr-info.eu/art-33-gdpr/) - all on strict timelines.  Legal counsel is needed to fully understand the reporting requirements across jurisdictions.

AI Systems bring new challenges to reporting for regulatory compliance:

* Personal data breaches from PII/PHI leakage from AI systems, applicable to US states’ data laws and GDPR
* Model confidentiality, integrity and accessibility attacks are breaches, even if affected indirectly
* AI service providers may be considered critical infrastructure, or be required to disclose incidents affecting customer use of AI services

### 3.5.2. Information Sharing with Community

One of defenders’ greatest advantages against attackers is information sharing, as timely well-structured information about attacks enables defenders to prevent similar attacks.  Incident information sharing is evolving from sector based [ISAC](https://www.nationalisacs.org/about-isacs) reporting to more strict national and supranational reporting requirements from CIRCIA, CISA in the US and ENISA in the EU.  There are many fragmented and boutique reporting mechanisms too, including the [AI Incident Database](https://incidentdatabase.ai/), for community-driven reporting.  Cross-border open groups such as [FIRST](https://www.first.org/) offer best practices and standards for sharing IOCs, TTPs and for Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure.  The security community supports the use of OASIS [STIX 2.1](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/stix/v2.1/csprd01/stix-v2.1-csprd01.html) to share information widely, with OpenCTI the intended target open source tool for managing threat intelligence within or across organizations.  Open sharing of threat intelligence is still a challenge for enterprises and even the security community, often because complying with data privacy regulation discourages additional anonymization work required.

AI incident reporting will often require:

* Data scrubbing to remove PII from incident report, possibly data used by AI system
* Associating IOCs and TTPs with attacks against the AI system
* Responsible disclosure of AI vulnerabilities to AI providers

# 4. Frameworks and Playbooks

## 4.1. NIST SP 800-61r3 Alignment

***Reference:*** [NIST SP 800-61r3](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-61r3.pdf)

The NIST SP 800-61 Revision 3 (2025) modernizes incident response by embedding it within the broader context of cybersecurity risk management through alignment with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) 2.0. Unlike its predecessor, which focused on procedural guidance, this version adopts a flexible, outcome-driven approach using the six CSF Functions—Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover—to guide organizations in managing, mitigating, and learning from cybersecurity incidents. The framework emphasizes continuous improvement, cross-functional coordination, and real-time learning across incident stages, integrating threat intelligence, asset visibility, and policy enforcement into an adaptive lifecycle. For AI systems and generative AI applications, the framework is especially applicable as it supports incident response for AI-specific threats such as prompt injection, model inversion, hallucinations, data leakage, adversarial misuse of toolchains (e.g., LangChain agents), and retrieval augmentation abuse. It enables organizations to adapt incident handling playbooks, define AI-relevant response roles, log and monitor AI inputs/outputs, and apply continuous learning to secure model and agent behaviors and limit data exposures. Through its flexible and modular structure, SP 800-61r3 provides a resilient foundation for defending dynamic, intelligent, and increasingly autonomous AI ecosystems.

### 4.1.1. Key Concept

SP 800-61r3 shifts from static procedural guidance to a flexible, CSF 2.0-aligned risk management profile, suitable for dynamic, evolving technologies like AI systems.

It replaces the old linear IR lifecycle with a model mapped to the six CSF 2.0 Functions: Govern, Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover — all of which are critical for generative AI environments where risks emerge through prompt injection, model behavior, data flow, and tool orchestration.

| CSF Function | AI-Specific Considerations |
|--------------|-----------------------------|
| **Govern (GV)** | Establish AI-specific IR policies: include prompt injection, misuse of RAG pipelines, and training data exposures. Ensure third-party responsibilities (e.g., model vendors or SaaS orchestration) are contractually defined. |
| **Identify (ID)** | Inventory LLM tools, APIs, model endpoints, external connectors and data sources. Capture attack surfaces such as embeddings, memory modules, toolchains (LangChain, ReAct). Threat modeling must include jailbreaking and adversarial prompts. |
| **Protect (PR)** | Implement robust input/output guardrails, system prompts, and behavioral constraints. Ensure LLM telemetry, prompt logs, and PII filters are enabled. Validate training pipelines to prevent data poisoning or unintentional PII ingestion. |
| **Detect (DE)** | Continuously monitor prompt patterns, output anomalies, and system behavior. Correlate logs from LLM APIs, tool executions, and chat sessions. Integrate LLM-as-a-Judge metrics and fine-tuned filters to detect AI-targeted abuse. |
| **Respond (RS)** | Coordinate across AI/ML teams, SREs, legal, and security to investigate and contain AI-specific incidents like data leakage or unauthorized tool invocation. Update response plans to reflect LLM threats and recovery protocols. |
| **Recover (RC)** | Restore compromised AI services, rollback fine-tuned models or agent states, redact unsafe memory or embeddings. Update RAG sources and retrain if training data was involved in the breach. Conduct post-mortems with AI-specific lens. |

### 4.1.2. Key Recommendations

| ***NIST Recommendation***                     | ***AI System Implication***                                                                                          |
|-----------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Establish IR policy & procedures**    | Include AI-specific incident types and response playbooks for AI misuse, such as unauthorized API use, hallucinations, or data leakage. |
| **Communication protocols**             | Define rules for disclosure and response involving model vendors (e.g., OpenAI, Anthropic), data controllers, and regulators (for privacy breaches). |
| **Team structure**                      | Ensure inclusion of AI/ML engineers, data scientists, legal advisors, and system architects alongside traditional CSIRTs. |
| **Shared Responsibility**       | Contracts must clearly define incident roles/responsibilities across cloud services, model providers, and orchestration tools. |
| **Telemetry & Forensics**      | Log prompt/response pairs, tool execution traces, embeddings, and system prompts for investigation. |
| **Automated detection**                 | Leverage metrics from LLM guardrails, behavioral scoring, and RAG pipeline telemetry to detect attacks (e.g., prompt-based exfiltration). |
| **Incident Response Playbooks** | Define specific playbooks for generative AI issues: misuse of agents, hallucination of critical data, unauthorized RAG retrieval. |
| **Information sharing**                 | Coordinate with external AI incident hubs (like responsible AI research communities or regulatory bodies) for emerging attack techniques. |
| **Continuous Improvement (ID.IM)** | Post-incident lessons should inform prompt engineering updates, detection engineering improvements, model fine-tuning policies, and toolchain governance. |

## 4.2. OASIS CACAO Security Playbooks

***Reference:*** ([OASIS CACAO Security Playbooks Version 2.0](https://docs.oasis-open.org/cacao/security-playbooks/v2.0/cs01/security-playbooks-v2.0-cs01.html))

The Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (CACAO) Security Playbooks Version 2.0 specification defines a standardized schema and taxonomy for representing cybersecurity playbooks. These playbooks are structured workflows that define sequences of security actions — detection, prevention, mitigation, remediation, etc. — which can be executed manually or automatically across different tools and systems. CACAO enables the creation, sharing, and execution of these playbooks across organizational and technological boundaries, improving collaboration, incident response, and cyber defense automation.

### 4.2.1. Key Components

- ***Playbooks:*** - Represent orchestrated actions in response to threats (e.g., investigate, notify, isolate).
- ***Workflows:*** - Structured steps including conditional logic, parallel actions, and sub-playbook invocation.
- ***Commands:*** - Encapsulate specific executable operations (e.g., Bash, PowerShell, OpenC2, Yara).
- ***Agents & Targets:*** - Define who executes the actions and the affected systems/entities.

|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Attack**       | Orchestrates penetration testing or adversary emulation steps; used by red teams or simulation tools.|
| **Detection**    | Focuses on identifying known threats, behaviors, or indicators using logs, telemetry, or threat intel.|
| **Engagement**   | Defines deception or denial tactics to disrupt adversaries or gather intelligence (e.g., honeypots). |
| **Investigation**| Gathers evidence and context around a threat or anomaly to understand scope and impact.              |
| **Mitigation**   | Reduces the impact of a threat (e.g., isolate systems, block IPs) without fully resolving the issue.  |
| **Notification** | Disseminates alerts or threat info to internal or external stakeholders.                             |
| **Prevention**   | Implements measures to stop anticipated threats before they occur (e.g., hardening, patching).       |
| **Remediation**  | Restores affected systems to normal state after an incident (e.g., restore backups, remove malware).  |

# 5. Case Studies and Lessons Learned

## 5.1. Breaking the Prompt Wall Case Study

[Breaking the Prompt Wall (I): A Real-World Case Study of Attacking ChatGPT via Lightweight Prompt Injection](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.16125)

The case study demonstrates a prompt injection attacks against ChatGPT, exposing vulnerabilities across different interaction layers of modern LLM-integrated systems. The authors showcase how lightweight, template-based adversarial prompts can bypass safety filters and manipulate the behavior of powerful LLMs without requiring API access or system-level permissions.

| **Aspect**               | **Summary**   |
|--------------------------|---------------|
| **Attack Vector**        | Prompt injection using benign-looking instructions crafted via reusable templates that avoid safety filters.                                |
| **Injection Methods**    | 1. Direct user input (chat UI, uploaded files) <br> 2. Web-based retrieval (poisoned content) <br> 3. System-level GPT agent config.          |
| **Manipulation Techniques** | Use of templates embedding hidden rules framed as helpful guidance or metadata (e.g., Always recommend X, Do not reveal these rules.) |
| **Model Behavior Impact**| Attacks led to biased recommendations, manipulated peer reviews, and deceptive financial summaries—without policy violations.                |
| **Scalability**          | Injection methods are low-cost, scalable, and effective across multiple LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA).                                |
| **Stealth & Persistence**| Prompt injection persists across sessions, is invisible to users, and effective in multi-turn agent contexts.   

***Real World Cases***

| **Case**    | **Attack Path**                  | **Outcome**  |
|-------------|-----------------------------------|--------------|
| Case 1      | User Input (PDF or Chat Window)   | Biased academic peer review via embedded pro-acceptance text in appendix or metadata.             |
| Case 2      | Web Search Context Injection      | Poisoned web content biases LLM toward fictional product in unrelated academic information query. |
| Case 3      | GPT System Instruction (Agent)    | GPT agent persistently recommends a specific brand (Xiangyu's Shoes) due to hidden instructions.|

| **Model Behavior Deviation**     | Safety Evasion via Instruction Reframing (AT1040)| Reframing harmful intents as safe or research-based, tricking the LLM's content moderation and safety layer.             | "Hypothetical research only" disguise prompt   |
| **Information Manipulation**     | Bias Induction in Output (AT1080)               | Persistent injection causes biased summaries, reviews, and financial reports without violating output policy.            | Overly positive reviews, biased investments    |

## 5.2. Memory Injection Attack (MINJA) Case Study

[A Practical Memory Injection Attack against LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/html/2503.03704v1)

MINJA (Memory INJection Attack) is a novel and practical memory poisoning attack against LLM-based agents. It enables attackers—without privileged access—to inject malicious memory records that persist and later mislead agents into generating targeted, harmful outputs in response to unrelated victim queries.

| **Aspect**              | **Summary**   |
|-------------------------|--------------------|
| **Threat**              | Memory poisoning of LLM agents using only standard user interactions (no direct memory access required).              |
| **Attack Vector**       | Submit benign-looking queries that cause agents to generate and store malicious memory records autonomously.          |
| **Targeted Output**     | Malicious reasoning steps injected indirectly into memory and later retrieved as in-context demonstrations.            |
| **Payload Structure**   | (Victim Query, [Bridging Steps, Malicious Reasoning])                                                                 |
| **Trigger**             | A victim query containing a pre-selected entity (e.g., patient ID, product ID, sensitive term).                       |

***Real World Cases***

| **Case**         | **Agent Environment**            | **Attack Scenario**   | **Outcome**   |
|------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Medical Agent**| EHR-like memory (MIMIC-III/eICU) | Injected fabricated treatment reasoning linked to a patient ID.                                           | Agent retrieved poisoned memory and recommended incorrect treatment rationale for future patient queries. |
| **Shopping Agent**| Product advisor with persistent memory | Injected biased product reasoning into memory through templated prompts.                              | Later, unrelated shoppers received manipulated recommendations tied to attacker's injected memory.     |
| **QA Agent**     | General-purpose QA + memory      | Injected target reasoning into stored answers via indirect prompts.                                       | Agent recalled false logic as reference in unrelated educational or professional queries.              |

***Implications***

| **Implication Area**       | **Description**                                                                                                 |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Trustworthiness Erosion**| Users receive harmful or biased responses from queries that should be unrelated, reducing trust in LLM agents.  |
| **Stealth & Persistence**  | Injected memory is persistent across sessions and invisible to users or developers without explicit monitoring. |
| **Misuse Without Access**  | Attackers do not need API or memory access—just interaction permissions—making the attack hard to attribute.     |
| **Contamination Propagation** | Malicious reasoning may propagate through shared memory, tools, or agent behavior modeling.                  |
| **Evaluation Blind Spots** | Standard eval methods fail to detect latent memory injections unless triggered by specific victim queries.       |
| **RAG-Agentic Vulnerability** | Retrieval-augmented and autonomous systems are particularly exposed due to memory and planning dependencies.   |

| **ATLAS Tactic**           | **ATLAS Technique**                              | **MINJA-Relevant Behavior**    |
|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|----------|
| Input Manipulation         | Adversarial Prompt Injection (AT1070)           | Attackers craft queries that guide agents to produce and log malicious reasoning in memory.                 |
| Memory Poisoning           | Feedback Loop Attack (AT1081)                   | Injected outputs become persistent context that contaminates future agent behavior and planning.            |
| Contextual Corruption      | Data Poisoning (AT1050)                         | Agents store inaccurate or adversarial knowledge that later alters reasoning or decision-making.            |
| Planning Manipulation      | Goal Hijacking (Proposed extension)             | Poisoned memory interferes with multi-step planning, redirecting agent actions based on false context.      |
| Safety Bypass              | Safety Evasion via Semantic Framing (AT1040)    | Malicious content is framed as helpful or routine to bypass content filters and moderation.                 |
| Inference Exploitation     | Output Manipulation (AT1080)                   | Poisoned records influence model output during unrelated inference, misleading end users.                   |

## 5.3. Poison-RAG Case Study

[Poison-RAG: Adversarial Data Poisoning Attacks on Retrieval-Augmented Generation in Recommender Systems](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.11759)

The Poison-RAG attack demonstrates how adversaries can manipulate Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems by subtly poisoning item metadata—specifically tags—without access to model internals. By modifying only tags, attackers promote long-tail (low-popularity) items or demote popular items, exploiting vector similarity in semantic retrieval. The attack succeeds in black-box settings, impacts ranking and exposure, and remains difficult to detect with standard relevance metrics. Localized (item-specific) attacks are more effective than global strategies, and attempts to promote items are significantly less successful than demoting them. This highlights critical vulnerabilities in metadata-driven pipelines, especially for recommendation and RAG-enabled systems that rely on user- or item-generated content.

| **Aspect**                                  | **Summary**   |
|------------|---------------------------|
| Metadata tags can effectively poison RAG     | Tags—though often overlooked—can subtly manipulate item retrieval and LLM generation.                       |
| Attack works in black-box settings           | The attacker does not need model internals, just visibility into outputs and access to modify metadata.     |
| Demotion is easier than promotion            | It is easier to hide popular items than to boost long-tail items, due to entrenched exposure dynamics.      |
| Local attacks outperform global ones         | Personalized (local) tag poisoning is more precise and successful than global tag reuse strategies.         |
| Long-tail promotion is difficult             | Even successful attacks fail to push long-tail items significantly in ranking, especially with reranking.   |

***Real World Cases***

|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| E-Commerce         | Competitor injects biased tags to demote rival products and promote obscure alternatives.     | Manipulated product rankings, suppressed visibility, consumer trust erosion.                          |
| Content Platforms  | Malicious actors tag misinformation-rich videos with popular neutral tags.                   | Search relevance is corrupted; users are led to low-quality or unsafe content.                        |
| Personalized News  | Political content gets tagged to appear in non-political feeds (e.g., sports, finance).      | Indirect content injection into unintended interest domains, leading to misinformation exposure.       |

## 5.4. Capital One Data Breach Case Study

[A Case Study of the Capital One Data Breach](https://web.mit.edu/smadnick/www/wp/2020-07.pdf)

In March 2019, a former AWS employee exploited a misconfigured Web Application Firewall (WAF) and a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability to access Capital One's cloud-based AWS environment. The attacker retrieved temporary credentials from the instance metadata service and used them to access over 700 S3 buckets, exfiltrating personal data of over 106 million individuals. The breach occurred despite Capital One's formal adoption of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and compliance with multiple financial regulations. The incident revealed critical gaps in access control, vulnerability scanning, outbound traffic monitoring, and incident detection—emphasizing the need for real-time compliance enforcement, security automation, and cloud configuration auditing.

| **Aspect**        | **Summary**       |
|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| SSRF Exploited via WAF Misconfiguration          | The attacker used a WAF flaw to run SSRF and obtain credentials via the AWS metadata service.          |
| Lack of Real-time Monitoring and Alerting        | Logs existed, but Capital One failed to detect or respond to the intrusion in real time.                |
| Excessive IAM Privileges                         | The WAF role provided unnecessary permissions (violating least privilege), enabling S3 data access.     |
| Failure in Outbound Traffic Controls             | Data exfiltration occurred undetected due to weak outbound traffic monitoring.                          |
| Incomplete Implementation of NIST Controls       | Capital One adopted the NIST CSF but did not enforce controls like PR.AC-4, DE.CM-7, and PR.PT-1.       |
| Discovery Triggered by External Disclosure       | The incident was discovered via an external responsible disclosure, not internal defenses.              |

***Real World Cases***

| **Domain**          | **Scenario**      | **Outcome**         |
|---------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------|
| Financial Services  | Capital One stored credit application data in AWS; attacker exploited WAF misconfig to access it. | Over 106 million records exfiltrated; class action lawsuit and significant stock market reaction.      |
| Public Cloud Usage  | Cloud misconfig enabled AWS metadata access via SSRF.                                             | Temporary IAM credentials used to access and sync S3 bucket data.                                     |
| Insider Knowledge   | Attacker was a former cloud employee who understood system vulnerabilities.                       | Demonstrates insider threat potential even after employment ends.                                     |

|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Cloud Security Misconfiguration | Critical cloud assets can be exposed via overlooked WAF/firewall settings and poor IAM enforcement.     |
| Compliance Gaps                | Adopting frameworks like NIST CSF isn’t sufficient without operational enforcement and real-time controls.|
| SOC/NOC Detection Weakness     | Logs existed, but no automated detection or alerting occurred until public disclosure.                  |
| IAM Mismanagement              | The use of powerful credentials tied to non-isolated roles significantly increased attack impact.       |
| Trust and Financial Repercussions| 15% stock drop and class action lawsuits followed; reputational loss was immediate and substantial.     |
| Regulatory Inadequacy          | Existing laws and guidelines failed to anticipate SSRF and cloud-specific misconfigurations.             |

## 5.5. AGENTPOISON Case Study

[Red-teaming LLM Agents via Poisoning Memory or Knowledge Bases](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.12784)

AGENTPOISON is the first red-teaming framework that targets RAG-based LLM agents by injecting malicious demonstrations into their long-term memory or knowledge base. It uses a novel constrained optimization to generate stealthy backdoor triggers that, when present in user instructions, retrieve adversarial memory records from the RAG retriever, guiding agents to generate malicious actions. Notably, AGENTPOISON does not require model fine-tuning and achieves high success rates (ASR ≥ 80%) across multiple domains (driving, QA, healthcare) while preserving performance on benign queries (≤1% drop in accuracy). It is resilient, transferable across retrievers, and evades existing defenses, posing a severe threat to LLM agent safety.

| **Aspect**     | **Summary**      |
|-----------------|-----------------|
| Backdoor trigger poisons memory/RAG via stealthy prompts | Only a few optimized trigger tokens needed to consistently retrieve malicious demonstrations.           |
| No model fine-tuning required                       | AGENTPOISON performs purely via input manipulation, making it fast, cheap, and broadly applicable.      |
| High attack success rate across tasks               | Achieves ≥82% retrieval success and ≥63% end-to-end attack success on three real-world agents.           |
| Transferability across retrievers                  | Triggers optimized for one embedder work effectively on others (e.g., OpenAI-ADA, DPR, ORQA, REALM).    |
| Resilient to query perturbations                    | Maintains success even after word/letter injection or rephrasing of the trigger.                         |
| Stealthy trigger avoids detection                  | Trigger is coherent and semantically plausible, evading perplexity filters and rephrasing defenses.      |

***Real World Cases***

| **Domain**  | **Scenario**    | **Outcome**   |
|--------------------|------------|---------------|
| Autonomous Driving | Malicious trigger causes agent to retrieve STOP instructions, leading to unsafe braking.       | Deviation in trajectory and potential collision.                                                    |
| Healthcare Records | Trigger causes agent to issue DELETE command on patient data.                                   | Unsafe deletion of electronic health record (EHR) information.                                      |
| Knowledge QA       | Poisoned retrieval results in wrong or misleading answers to user queries.                     | User receives incorrect or unhelpful responses in education or research scenarios.                  |

***Implications***

| **Implication Area**              | **Impact**                                                                                             |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| LLM Agent Safety                 | Memory poisoning leads to unsafe actions (e.g., driving errors, wrong diagnoses, QA misinformation).    |
| Undetectable by traditional filters | Coherent and semantically valid triggers evade standard defenses like perplexity scoring or rephrasing. |
| Long-term persistence            | Poisoned records persist in memory or RAG knowledge base, making attacks durable and hard to clean.     |
| Cross-agent vulnerability        | The attack generalizes across agents and domains, indicating a systemic vulnerability in agent design.   |
| Compliance and audit failure     | Agents may silently violate safety/compliance without visibility to users or regulators.                |

## 8.1. Integration with Enterprise Security Roadmap

This section outlines a comprehensive integration framework for aligning incident response capabilities with an enterprise security roadmap. 

It presents a structured approach across four key implementation phases (further discussed in Section 3.3., Incident Response Workflow):
1. Preparation
2. Detection & Analysis
3. Containment, Eradication, and Recovery
4. Post-Incident Activity

Each phase addresses five critical integration areas: 
1. Framework Alignment
2. Handoff Procedures
3. Shared Terminology
4. Tool Integration
5. Unified Metrics

The framework provides specific success metrics and implementation indicators for each phase and integration area, enabling organizations to systematically measure their progress in creating a cohesive, enterprise-wide security incident response capability that bridges traditionally siloed security domains.

### CoSAI Focus 

CoSAI is an OASIS Open Project, bringing together an open ecosystem of AI and security experts from industry-leading organizations. The project is dedicated to sharing best practices for secure AI deployment and collaborating on AI security research and product development. The scope of CoSAI is specifically focused on the secure building, integration, deployment, and operation of AI systems, with an emphasis on mitigating security risks unique to AI technologies. Other aspects of Trustworthy AI are deemed important but beyond the scope of the project including, ethics, fairness, explainability, bias detection, safety, consumer privacy, misinformation, hallucinations, deep fakes, or content safety concerns like hateful or abusive content, malware, or phishing generation. By concentrating on developing robust measures, best practices, and guidelines to safeguard AI systems against unauthorized access, tampering, or misuse, CoSAI aims to contribute to the responsible development and deployment of resilient, secure AI technologies.

### Guidelines on usage of more advanced AI systems (e.g. large language models (LLMs), multi-modal language models. etc) for drafting documents for OASIS CoSAI:

tl;dr: CoSAI contributions are actions performed by humans, who are responsible for the content of those contributions, based on their signed OASIS iCLA (and eCLA, if applicable). \[Each contributor must confirm whether they are entitled to donate that material under the applicable open source license;  OASIS and the CoSAI Project do not separately confirm that.\]  Each contributor is responsible for ensuring that all contributions comply with these AI use guidelines, including disclosure of any use of AI in contributions.  

* Selection of AI systems: CoSAI recommends the use of reputable AI systems (lowering the risk of inadvertently incorporating infringing material).  
* Model constraints: Currently, CoSAI or OASIS are not required to have a contract or financial agreement for using AI systems from specific vendors. However, CoSAI editors should consider employing varying tools to avoid potential fairness concerns among vendors.  
* IP infringement: It is the responsibility of the individual who subscribes/prompts and receives a response from an AI system to confirm they have the right to repost and donate the content to OASIS under our rules.  
* Transparency: CoSAI’s goal will be to maintain transparency throughout the process by documenting substantial use of AI systems whenever possible (e.g., the prompts and the AI system used), and to ensure that all content, regardless of production by human or AI systems, was reviewed and edited by human experts. This helps build trust in the standards development process and ensures accountability.  
* Human-edited content and quality control: CoSAI mandates human-reviewed or \-edited results for any final outputs. A robust quality control process should be in place, involving careful review of the generated content for accuracy, relevance, and alignment with CoSAI's goals and principles. Human experts should scrutinize the output of AI systems to identify any errors, inconsistencies, or potential biases.  
* Iterative refinement: The use of AI systems in drafting standards should be seen as an iterative process, with the generated content serving as a starting point for further refinement and improvement by human experts. Multiple rounds of review and editing may be necessary to ensure the final standards meet the required quality and reliability thresholds.
