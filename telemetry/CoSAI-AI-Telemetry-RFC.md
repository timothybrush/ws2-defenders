# Secure by Design: Telemetry Field Selection for AI Systems {**Working Draft v0.4**}

**Status:** Request for Comments, revision 0.4
**Origin:** Coalition for Secure AI (CoSAI), Workstream 2 (Defenders)
**Disclosure:** Prepared for open publication under CoSAI. No commercial sponsorship; the standards positions taken favour open specifications (OpenTelemetry, OCSF, OWASP AOS, CPEX) over any vendor implementation. Drafting, cross-referencing, and consistency checking were performed with AI assistance; every attack, field, mapping, and citation must be verified before release.

## 1. Introduction

AI systems now read untrusted content, decide what to do about it, and act: calling tools, writing memory, retrieving documents, sending mail, invoking other agents. Attacks against them succeed in the gap between reading and acting. Detection has to happen in that gap, as far left in the kill chain as possible.

Catching an injection attack in flight means knowing what the model was given, how far that input was trusted, what it decided to do, and where its output went. Most deployments record none of this. Traditional application logging captures HTTP requests, database queries, and authentication events. The decisive moments in an AI system (an instruction arriving inside a retrieved document, a guardrail verdict, a memory write that will shape every future session) leave no trace there. Without those records there is nothing to detect against, and afterwards nothing solid to investigate, debug, or audit.

### 1.1 One umbrella, many efforts

Several communities are converging on AI telemetry, and their work is complementary. **OpenTelemetry** [[29]](#standards--frameworks) defines how instrumentation emits GenAI and agent data. **OCSF**, the Open Cybersecurity Schema Framework [[31]](#standards--frameworks), defines how security events are normalized for a SOC. **OWASP AOS**, the Agent Observability Standard [[32]](#standards--frameworks), defines how an agent exposes itself for observation. **CPEX** [[38]](#standards--frameworks) defines how a policy runtime mediates agent actions. **ODIS**, the Open Delegation and Identity Standard [[20]](#standards--frameworks), defines delegated identity and authority. **MITRE ATLAS** [[1]](#primary-sources-attack-corpus--taxonomy) defines the adversary techniques to classify against. Regulation adds its own obligations, notably EU AI Act Article 12 [[28]](#standards--frameworks) and the NIST AI Risk Management Framework [[24]](#standards--frameworks).

Those efforts answer different questions. The open question this RFC addresses is which fields must exist, why, and at what priority.

This RFC is a requirements layer for security telemetry, not a wire format. It specifies the fields an AI system must produce for security, the evidence that makes each field necessary, and a suggested build order.

### 1.2 For example: EchoLeak

In June 2025 Microsoft disclosed **EchoLeak** (CVE-2025-32711, CVSS 9.3), reported by Aim Labs [[4]](#real-world-attack-primary-sources). A single crafted email caused Microsoft 365 Copilot to retrieve the attacker's text as context, act on it as instruction, and exfiltrate internal SharePoint, OneDrive and Teams content to an attacker-controlled endpoint. No user ever clicked anything. The chain defeated the cross-prompt-injection classifier, link redaction, and content-security policy in turn, and routed the egress through a trusted proxy domain.

Each step in that chain is detectable, and each depends on a field most deployments do not collect:

- The email entered as **untrusted data** and was acted on as instruction, a distinction nothing recorded.
- The run was **autonomous**; no human initiated it, which is itself the strongest first filter for injection.
- The **injection classifier was bypassed**. A classifier whose verdicts are not logged cannot be shown to have failed.
- Content left for a **previously unseen outbound destination**: the last point at which the attack could have been stopped rather than reconstructed afterwards.

Four fields, none exotic. Their absence is the difference between a detection and a disclosure notice.

## 2. How To Use This Doc

### 2.1 For CISOs

Go to the **classification summary** ([§4.5](#45-classification-summary), the single table listing every field by component and tier) and treat the **applicable subset of the MUST column** as the baseline each AI deployment should meet. The three tiers are **MUST**, **SHOULD**, and **MAY**, used in the RFC 2119 sense and defined in [§4.2](#42-classification-legend). The catalogue contains 47 MUST fields; a deployment's baseline consists of those whose defining component, operation, or event exists in that deployment. This is the artifact to take into an engineering plan or a budget discussion.

- **The justification is evidentiary.** Every MUST field cites named real-world attacks and incidents. The ask is "these fields catch these attacks," not "best practice suggests." [Appendix J](#appendix-j-tiering-rationale) sets out that reasoning per component if it is challenged.
- **There is a build order.** The MUST tier is sequenced, so a team starts with the identifiers and content that everything else correlates through rather than instrumenting alphabetically.
- **Compliance follows detection, not the reverse.** MUST coverage already evidences most of NIST CSF [[25]](#standards--frameworks) **DETECT** and **RESPOND**, AI RMF **MEASURE**, and ISO/IEC 42001 [[27]](#standards--frameworks) event-logging control; the mappings are in [Appendix H](#appendix-h-implications-for-nist-ai-rmf-and-nist-csf-incl-the-cyber-ai-profile) and [Appendix I](#appendix-i-implications-for-isoiec-42001), which show coverage strongest exactly where this document concentrates and weakest where it places least weight. Build for detection and the audit evidence is a by-product; building for audit does not produce detection.

One decision cannot be delegated to engineering: how much prompt, response, and memory content is retained, for how long, and who may read it. The MUST tier can be met with hashes and classifications where raw content is too sensitive to keep, but that is a policy call, and it should be made deliberately rather than defaulted into.

### 2.2 For the open source security community

Every adjacent standard has its own appendix, stating what this field set already maps onto, what that standard cannot currently express, and the specific additions proposed. Start with yours.

| Community | Appendix | What is proposed |
| :------------- | :---- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **OpenTelemetry** [[29]](#standards--frameworks) | D | 9 attribute proposals: input trust classification, a security guardrail signal, memory provenance and footprint, retrieval provenance, turn and step identifiers |
| **OCSF** [[31]](#standards--frameworks) | E | 4 asks: two AI event classes (tracking ocsf-schema#1640), extensions to the existing `ai_operation` profile (ocsf-schema#1704 and #1729 in flight), new objects and enums; ATLAS technique tagging needs no schema change |
| **CoSAI Risk Map (WS3)** [[17]](#standards--frameworks) | B | 3 refinements: confirm `componentMemory` covers persistent long-term memory, add a component for background and scheduled execution, and require the ATLAS technique tag on `controlThreatDetection` |
| **OWASP AOS** [[32]](#standards--frameworks) | F | 9 contributions: trust classification, egress destination, ATLAS tagging, priority tiering, and migration of its OTel binding from `llm.*` to `gen_ai.*` |
| **CPEX** [[38]](#standards--frameworks) | G | 6 contributions: retention and priority guidance, and a SOC destination for enforcement decisions |

Several Appendix E asks already have live OCSF vehicles from CoSAI-adjacent work, and Appendix E references them rather than proposing anew: the normalized stop reason is [ocsf-schema#1704](https://github.com/ocsf/ocsf-schema/pull/1704); the `ai_tool` / MCP object is drafted in [ocsf-schema#1729](https://github.com/ocsf/ocsf-schema/pull/1729) with a worked five-event example; the agent trust-base inventory and declared-versus-executed split are proposed as a Discovery class in [ocsf-schema#1724](https://github.com/ocsf/ocsf-schema/issues/1724); the agent-activity and delegation-activity classes trace to [ocsf-schema#1640](https://github.com/ocsf/ocsf-schema/issues/1640). Event-sequence integrity is already ratified as the `record_integrity` profile in OCSF 1.9.0 ([ocsf-schema#1661](https://github.com/ocsf/ocsf-schema/pull/1661)).

**AITF** [[19]](#standards--frameworks), the AI Telemetry Framework, donated to CoSAI Workstream 2, is the bridge between this document and both of those destinations, OpenTelemetry for emission, OCSF for consumption. It carries these fields as OpenTelemetry attributes today and emits them into OCSF ahead of formal ratification, so adopters are not blocked on either standards body. The field-level mapping is **Appendix C**; completing it is CoSAI's own work, in hand before final publication.

- **They are evidence-gated and therefore small.** A field becomes a standardization ask only once two or more independent documented attacks require it. Nothing is proposed speculatively.
- **Emission and consumption move together.** A field OpenTelemetry emits but OCSF cannot represent arrives at the SIEM as unstructured overflow; a field OCSF defines but no instrumentation produces stays theoretical. Paired asks are the intent.

CoSAI is engaging the **OpenTelemetry** and **OCSF** communities directly on this work, and welcomes input from the wider open source security community in turn. The timing favours it: every OpenTelemetry GenAI convention is at *Development* status and has just moved to a dedicated repository, so contributions land more cheaply now than after stabilization.

What is wanted in return: corrections to the mappings, and attacks the corpus is missing.

### 2.3 For builders of AI solutions

One telemetry set covers **detection** while a run is in flight, **response** afterwards, **debugging** of behaviour, and **compliance audit**. Instrumenting once for all four is cheaper than retrofitting each purpose later.

Work from the **per-component breakdown**. The field set is organized by the components of an AI system (reasoning core, input handling, output handling, model and serving, tools, memory, retrieval, orchestration, identity and delegation, asset inventory, observability plane, and policy enforcement) so you can take the components you actually build and read off what each must emit. Every field states what to capture and the attacks that make it necessary. The correlation patterns that follow the field tables show how fields combine into detections, and are usually the fastest way to see why a given field earns its place.

Practical notes:

- **Do not invent a schema.** Appendices C to E give the OpenTelemetry attribute names and the OCSF mapping. Emit over OpenTelemetry today; the bindings are already specified.
- **Content in events, identifiers in span attributes, aggregates in metrics.** Prompts, tool results, and retrieved documents are unbounded and often sensitive; as span attributes they break cardinality limits and follow the span into every backend.
- **Do not head-sample security events.** Default OpenTelemetry sampling [[30]](#standards--frameworks) discards attack evidence blind to whether an event is security-relevant. Guardrail verdicts, refusals, tool errors, and authorization denials are recorded at 100%.
- **Propagate trace context across every hop**, including MCP [[33]](#standards--frameworks) and agent-to-agent [[34]](#standards--frameworks) calls. Without it, multi-agent activity cannot be reassembled into a single incident.

## 3. Scope

### 3.1 In scope

The security-relevant telemetry an AI system should produce: which fields, justified by which documented attacks, at which priority. Fields are organized by the component that emits them (reasoning core, input and output handling, model and serving, tools, memory, retrieval, orchestration, identity and delegation, asset inventory, observability plane, and policy enforcement) and each is tiered **MUST**, **SHOULD**, or **MAY** against a stated test. The document adds correlation patterns showing how fields combine into detections, and mappings onto OpenTelemetry, OCSF, AITF, ODIS, OWASP AOS, CPEX, the CoSAI Risk Map, NIST CSF and AI RMF, and ISO/IEC 42001.

Telemetry for **agents the deployment does not operate** is in scope, with the limits that implies: what is observable at your own boundary, plus whatever the counterparty presents and can be verified. [§4.7](#47-agents-you-do-not-operate) sets out how the field set applies in that case.

The framing implies three limits. This is **not a wire format**: the bindings are in the appendices. It does **not specify detection logic**, only the fields detections consume. And it covers the **security** slice of AI trustworthiness; fairness, bias, safety alignment, and environmental impact are outside its remit.

### 3.2 Not in scope

Two areas are excluded deliberately, and both are intended for subsequent work.

**Privacy compliance.** The implementation guidance recommends handling practices (access control, tiered retention, redaction, hash-first correlation) because content-bearing fields carry evident risk. Those are handling practices, not a compliance programme. Lawful basis, data-subject rights, cross-border transfer, and impact-assessment obligations are not addressed, and meeting the MUST tier does not discharge them.

**Security of the telemetry itself.** The field set treats the telemetry plane as an asset only insofar as it must report its own failure: the observability-plane section covers detecting suppressed events, unreached enforcement points, and incomplete instrumentation. Defending the pipeline is a different problem and is not solved here: authenticating emitters, securing transport and storage, controlling access to collected content, and establishing the tamper-evidence and chain of custody that evidentiary use requires. This is a genuine tension with the immutable, tamper-evident logging that classic audit practice expects, and it is an exclusion of *this document's* scope rather than a claim that the problem does not matter: the CoSAI Risk Map now carries `controlAuditTrailIntegrityVerification` and `controlAuditRecordRepositoryIndependence` for it, and [§15](#15-observability-plane-integrity) records when the plane fails even though it does not defend it.

---

## 4. How to read the field set

Each section below is a fine-grained component (or a tightly related cluster). Field tables use these columns:

- **Field**: conceptual field name (implementation-neutral).
- **Cls**: MUST / SHOULD / MAY.
- **Capture (concept)**: what to record, stated generally enough to bind to any framework.
- **Evidence**: attack IDs that establish the need (see Appendix A).

The reasoning behind each tier is in **[Appendix J](#appendix-j-tiering-rationale)**; AITF and ODIS attribute names are in **[Appendix C](#appendix-c-aitf--odis-cross-reference)**.

### 4.1 Use-case priorities

Every field is justified against four use cases, **in this priority order**:

| | Use case | What it means |
| :---- | :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **D** | **Threat detection** | Enables a detection to fire on an attack in progress. *Highest priority.* |
| **R** | **Incident response** | Enables scoping, attribution, containment, and forensic reconstruction after the fact. |
| **Q** | **Service debugging / quality** | Explains why the system behaved as it did; performance, cost, and correctness. |
| **A** | **Compliance audit** | Evidences a control to an auditor or regulator. *Lowest priority.* |

Where a field serves several, the **highest-priority** use case governs its tier. A field whose value is mainly Q or A does not reach MUST no matter how useful it is.

### 4.2 Classification legend

The keywords **MUST**, **SHOULD**, and **MAY** are used as defined in **RFC 2119** [[45]](#standards--frameworks), as updated by **RFC 8174** [[46]](#standards--frameworks): they carry that meaning only in capitals, so lowercase "optional" or "should" elsewhere in this document is ordinary prose. Each field carries exactly one keyword, and the table below states both the RFC 2119 obligation and the evidentiary test this document applies to assign it.

| Tag | Meaning | Test |
| :---- | :-------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **MUST** | Baseline. Required whenever the field is applicable under the rules below. | Grounded in **≥ 2 independent attacks** in [Appendix A](#appendix-a-attack--incident-inventory); **or 1 attack where the field is especially useful for D or R**; *and* implementable on essentially any current system that has the relevant component, operation, or event. |
| **SHOULD** | Required once a deployment adopts a modality or faces a threat scenario at the **edge of current agentic practice**. | The field serves a deployment modality or threat scenario that is emerging rather than typical; **delegation chains and cascaded authority**, cryptographic identity and attestation, agent-to-agent protocol surfaces, inline enforcement that mutates payloads, dynamic third-party capability composition, or self-attesting instrumentation. Attack grounding may be **analogical**: the corpus motivates the scenario without yet containing a documented instance. |
| **MAY** | Valuable, but not required to catch the core attack classes. | The field's dominant value is **Q or A**; or its attack motivation is thin (single weak instance, or none); or it is a research-grade signal, a derived detector output, or redundant with a MUST field. |

- **Attack count alone does not set the tier.** A field cited by five attacks is still SHOULD if every one of those attacks presupposes a delegation chain, and still MAY if its real job is compliance reporting. The modality gate applies after the evidence gate.
- **SHOULD is not "MUST later."** It is "MUST *if you run this modality*." This is the RFC 2119 reading applied narrowly: the "valid reasons in particular circumstances" for omitting a SHOULD field are **not running the modality it describes**, and nothing else. Cost, effort, and inconvenience are not among them. A deployment with cascaded delegation should treat §13 as mandatory on day one; a single-agent deployment may never need it.
- **Applicability precedes obligation.** A tier does not require a deployment to add a component or manufacture an event solely to emit its telemetry. A MUST field applies when its defining component, operation, or event exists: for example, §10 applies when the deployment uses persistent memory, and **Inter-Agent Message** applies when an agent-to-agent message is sent. A deployment that lacks the relevant capability marks the field **not applicable** in its conformance statement; it does not emit a synthetic value.
- **Schema support and event emission are distinct.** A conformant implementation supports every applicable MUST field and emits it whenever the corresponding event occurs. An individual event carries only the fields applicable to that event class and activity. Absence because the event did not occur is not a defect; omission from an event to which the field applies is.

> Tags are **deployment-agnostic**: a tag reflects *what evidence requires the field* and *how common the modality is*, not any one vendor's maturity. See the maturity model in [Implementation Guidance](#18-implementation-guidance).


### 4.3 Component taxonomy

Fields are organized under the CoSAI Risk Map fine-grained components. The component IDs used below are the canonical IDs from [`risk-map/yaml/components.yaml`](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/secure-ai-tooling/blob/main/risk-map/yaml/components.yaml):

| Category | Components referenced in this document |
| :-------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Application (Core)** | `componentApplication`, `componentApplicationInputHandling`, `componentApplicationOutputHandling` |
| **Application (Agent)** | `componentReasoningCore`, `componentAgentUserQuery`, `componentAgentSystemInstruction`, `componentAgentInputHandling`, `componentAgentOutputHandling` |
| **Model (Orchestration)** | `componentOrchestrationInputHandling`, `componentOrchestrationOutputHandling`, `componentTools`, `componentMemory`, `componentRAGContent` |
| **Model (Core / Training)** | `componentTheModel`, `componentModelFrameworksAndCode`, `componentModelEvaluation` |
| **Infrastructure (Deployment / Data)** | `componentModelServing`, `componentModelStorage`, `componentDataStorage`, `componentDataSources` |

### 4.4 Attack ID scheme

- **`TA-01…13`**: real-world attack vectors, each with its own field-detection mapping. **`TA-01` is EchoLeak** (M365 Copilot, CVE-2025-32711), the document's lead public case study, and the first entry in the catalogue. **`TA-02…10`** are the authoritative catalogue: Slack AI, Bard markdown exfil, training-data extraction, Samsung leak, LangChain RCE, system-prompt extraction, tool-chaining escalation, RAG-KB poisoning, context-window DoS. **`TA-11…13`** are MCP-mediated incidents from CoSAI's **MCP Security** paper.
- **`IR-01…05`**: CoSAI WS2 *AI Incident Response* case studies.
- **`AOC-01…16`**: *Agents of Chaos* (arXiv:2602.20021) case studies.
- **`AML.Txxxx`**: **MITRE ATLAS** technique IDs. **This is the canonical adversary-technique taxonomy for this document**, and the only one that may appear in new material or in emitted telemetry ([decision](#attack-taxonomy-mitre-atlas-is-canonical)). The CoSAI `AT10xx` labels used by the incident-response case studies are **deprecated aliases**, retained solely so existing material can be migrated, see the alias table in [Appendix A.4](#a4-attack-taxonomy-cosai-at10xx-codes-deprecated-aliases-to-mitre-atlas). The full attack→ATLAS mapping is [Appendix A.5](#a5-attack-inventory--mitre-atlas-technique-mapping).

### 4.5 Classification summary

The complete field-by-component classification, before the detailed tables that follow. It is an index rather than a definition: each field name is defined, with what to capture, when it applies, and the attacks that motivate it, in the section shown against it. The table is a catalogue, not a claim that every deployment or every event emits every field; the [applicability rules](#42-classification-legend) determine each deployment's required subset. The reasoning behind each tier (why the MUSTs are MUST, and where the boundaries are closest) is in **[Appendix J](#appendix-j-tiering-rationale)**, ordered to match this table.

| Component (risk-map) | MUST fields | SHOULD fields | MAY fields |
| :-------- | :---------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------ | :---------------- |
| Application / Reasoning Core (§5) | Agent Name, Instance ID, Workflow ID, Session/Turn/Step IDs, Trace Context, Trigger Type & Source Event, Action Type, Exec Status, Surface, System Prompt | Autonomy Level, Organization/Tenant ID | n/a |
| Input Handling (§6) | Model Input, Input Source, Input Trust Class, Source IP, Guardrail(In), Content Modality & Attachment Identity ‡, ATLAS Technique Tag † | Guardrail Modification Record ‡ | Encoded-Payload Indicator |
| Output Handling (§7) | Response, Output Egress, Citations / Source Attribution, Guardrail(Out), LLM Refusal | Observation/Thought | n/a |
| Model & Serving (§8) | Model Name/Version, Inference Parameters, Token Counts, LLM Error | Model Provenance/Signing | Pre-Forward State, Token Malformation, Provider/Endpoint Identity |
| Tools (§9) | Tool Call I/O, Tool Name, Tool Type, Tool Execution ID, Execution Environment / Sandbox, Tool Error | Tool ACL/Scope, Tool Selection Rationale, *Tool Definition Digest*, MCP Server Identity & Primitive | Tool ID, Tool Privacy Class |
| Memory (§10) | Memory Write, Memory Read, Memory Provenance, Memory Footprint | Memory Integrity/Poisoning, Memory Write Rationale | Declared Memory Configuration |
| RAG (§11) | Retrieval Event, Retrieved-Content Source | Content/Metadata Integrity | Declared Knowledge-Source Configuration |
| Orchestration / Multi-Agent (§12) | Inter-Agent Message, Background Task, Loop Signal, Resource Aggregate | Task/Intent Declaration, *A2A Task Lifecycle Event*, Peer Agent Card / Descriptor | Protocol Envelope Capture |
| Identity & Delegation (§13) | Identities Used, Verified-vs-Displayed Identity | Originating Principal, Delegation Chain, Granted Authorizations, Resource Indicators+Constraints, **Credential Minting & Scope-Narrowing**, **Trust-Domain Crossing & Delegation Depth**, Runtime Credential/Attestation, Lifecycle State | n/a |
| Asset & Fleet (§14) | Capability-Set Change Event | Version, Repository/Software Ref, AgBOM / Inventory Snapshot, Component Dependency Graph, Inventory Attestation Signature | Description, Status, Creator/Oncall/dates, Surfaces, Fleet counts |
| Observability-Plane Integrity (§15) | n/a | Instrumentation Coverage / Hook Attestation, Event Sequence Continuity, Enforcement-Point Availability & Failure Mode | Policy Reason Code |
| Policy Enforcement & Mediation (§16) | **Authorization Decision Record**, **Attribute Source / Trusted-Provenance Marking** ‡ | **Session Taint Labels & Information-Flow Decisions**, **Human Approval / Elicitation Event**, **Backend / Route Restriction Decision**, **Mediation Coverage & Bypass Path** | n/a |

† **Threat Classification / ATLAS Technique Tag** is a cross-cutting enrichment listed under §6 for convenience; it applies to any flagged event across all components and is **MUST when a detection fires**. Value = one or more MITRE ATLAS `AML.Txxxx` IDs from [Appendix A.5](#a5-attack-inventory--mitre-atlas-technique-mapping).

‡ Also cross-cutting, also listed under §6 for convenience. **Content Modality & Attachment Identity** applies to every content-bearing field (model input, response, memory item, retrieved item, tool argument). **Guardrail Modification Record** applies to any enforcement point that rewrites rather than blocks, on either the input or the output side. **Attribute Source / Trusted-Provenance Marking** (§16) applies to every security-relevant attribute a hostile agent could fabricate.


---

### 4.6 Where to start

The full MUST catalogue contains 47 fields, which is more than most full-stack deployments can instrument at once. Within a deployment's applicable subset, adoption has an order.

**Adoption order for a deployment starting from zero.** (1) the identifier hierarchy and trace context (§5), because everything else correlates through them and nothing else is interpretable without them; (2) content, trust classification, and guardrail verdicts (§§6 to 7), the highest D-density cluster in the document; (3) tool call I/O with execution IDs and sandbox posture (§9), the highest R value; (4) memory and retrieval (§§10 to 11); (5) orchestration (§12); (6) identity (§13) and capability-set change (§14).

**Early SHOULD fields that protect Tier 1 value**, even before the matching modality is fully adopted: **Enforcement-Point Availability** (§15), without which a starved guardrail is indistinguishable from a clean pass, and **Guardrail Modification Record** (§6), without which a redaction pipeline silently falsifies the log it feeds.

The order is driven by dependency: identifiers come first because later detections resolve through them. Each step is also useful on its own; stopping after step (2) still leaves a working injection-detection capability. See [§18](#18-implementation-guidance) for additional detail: the full maturity model across all three tiers, how to operationalize these fields for detection, and the privacy constraints on logging the content-bearing ones.

### 4.7 Agents you do not operate

Much of the corpus involves a counterparty someone else runs: another owner's agent (`AOC-04`, `AOC-09`, `AOC-11`, `AOC-16`), an MCP server you did not deploy (`TA-12`, `TA-13`), or a shared multi-tenant service (`TA-11`). You cannot instrument what you do not operate, so the field set applies differently. The adjacent standards each supply a useful rule:

**From CPEX: the counterparty is on the hostile side of the monitor, by definition.** CPEX's boundary places the agent, the caller, and everything beyond it in the untrusted region, and admits nothing from there into policy. An external agent is simply the clearest case. The consequence for telemetry is that you instrument **your own boundary**, not their internals, and CPEX's inbound-gateway placement is the one that sees every caller. What you record is a mediated interaction, not an observed agent.

**From ODIS: authority becomes legible through presented claims, not through inspection.** You cannot audit an external agent's reasoning, but you can require it to present a verifiable delegation record: originating principal, chain, granted authorizations, constraints. This is why `trust_domain` and delegation depth are detection-grade rather than mere policy-engine inputs the moment a chain leaves your domain (see §13).

**From OWASP AOS: ask the counterparty to be inspectable, and record the answer.** AOS's *Observed Agent* is one that exposes hooks, events, and an AgBOM on request; an external agent is an **unobserved** agent until it agrees otherwise. AOS's A2A extension already distinguishes full from partial counterparty context, which is the same distinction as knowing versus not knowing who you are talking to. Whether an inspection request was answered is itself a signal.

Read every field in §§5 to 16 against one of these **knowability** tiers:

| Tier | What you have | How the field set applies |
| :------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------ |
| **Mediated** | You own the boundary the interaction crosses | Full boundary telemetry: §§6, 7, 9, 16 apply as written. The counterparty's internals are absent, and their absence is expected rather than a gap |
| **Attested** | The counterparty presents verifiable claims (ODIS credential, signed AgBOM, agent card) | Record the claim **and its verification outcome**. **Attribute Source / Trusted-Provenance Marking** (§16) is the mechanism: an unverified claim is `self-asserted`, whatever it asserts |
| **Opaque** | Only the wire interaction | §§6, 7, 12 at the protocol surface, and nothing more. **Do not synthesize** fields you cannot observe. An opaque counterparty should be visibly opaque in the telemetry, not silently defaulted |

The third row collapsing into the second is the failure to avoid: recording an external agent's self-description as though it were established fact. `AOC-08` is that failure in miniature, and `AOC-11` is its consequence at scale.

## 5. Application & Agent Reasoning Core
**Components:** `componentApplication`, `componentReasoningCore`, `componentAgentUserQuery`, `componentAgentSystemInstruction`

*Establishes **what** is running and **where**: the asset inventory of the AI attack surface and the trace anchor for every incident.*

| Field | Cls | Capture (concept) | Evidence |
| :------------ | :---- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------ |
| **Agent Name** | MUST | Logical name/type of the agent (e.g. "Deep Research agent"). Detects off-inventory / "shadow" agents. | `AOC-08`,`AOC-10`,`TA-01`,`TA-05` |
| **Agent (Runtime) Instance ID** | MUST | UUID pinning an event to one running instance, not just the type. Enables per-instance kill/quarantine. | `AOC-04`,`AOC-05`,`AOC-08` |
| **Workflow / Run ID** | MUST | Groups all activity of one multi-step run or sub-agent tree into a single traceable execution. | `AOC-04`,`AOC-09`,`AOC-10` |
| **Session / Turn / Step IDs** **[AOS]** | MUST | The three-level execution hierarchy *beneath* the run: `session_id` (the conversation/engagement), `turn_id` (one request→response cycle), `step_id` (one action within a turn). Lets a detection point at *which* turn behaviour changed, not just which run. | `AOC-03`,`AOC-07`,`TA-07`,`TA-08` |
| **Trace Context (propagated)** **[AOS]** | MUST | W3C `traceparent` / `trace_id` + `span_id` **propagated across every agent→tool→agent hop**, including MCP and A2A calls. Without propagation, multi-agent activity cannot be reassembled into one trace. | `AOC-04`,`AOC-09`,`TA-01`,`TA-08` |
| **Organization / Tenant ID** **[AOS]** | SHOULD | The tenant/organization owning the agent, the session, and the invoking user, recorded on each. The primitive for detecting cross-tenant leakage and credential propagation. | `AOC-02`,`AOC-05`,`TA-05`,`TA-01`,`TA-11` |
| **Trigger Type & Source Event** **[AOS]** | MUST | Whether this run was **user-initiated or autonomous**, and for autonomous runs the originating event (inbound email, chat message, webhook, schedule). Distinct from Surface/App, which records the *channel*, not who or what started the run. | `TA-01`,`AOC-04`,`AOC-10`,`AOC-12` |
| **Action Type** | MUST | Distinguishes LLM-call vs tool-call vs memory-op vs message-send, the "think → act" boundary. | `AOC-01`,`AOC-02`,`IR-01` |
| **Execution Status** | MUST | Outcome of the operation or turn (complete / error / exit / aborted) + duration. Spikes/timeouts reveal probing, DoS, or mass failure. Distinct from **Stop Reason** below, which records why a *completion* ended. | `AOC-05`,`AOC-06`,`IR-04`,`TA-04`,`TA-10` |
| **Stop Reason** | SHOULD | Normalized reason a model completion ended: end of turn, token limit, tool use pending, session stop (caller cancelled or disconnected), content filter. Separates a truncation from a clean stop and a guardrail kill from a crash; a `content_filter` stop is the completion-side view of a guardrail block (§7). | `TA-04`,`TA-10`,`IR-01` |
| **Surface / App** | MUST | Entry point (CLI, web, IDE, email, chat channel, cron/heartbeat; internal vs external service). Detects access from unexpected surfaces. | `AOC-08`,`AOC-10`,`TA-01`,`TA-05` |
| **System Prompt / Instruction Config** | MUST | The system/instruction configuration in force for the call. Detects unauthorized weakening and, by comparison against the response, system-prompt leakage/extraction. | `TA-07`,`AOC-08`,`AOC-10` |
| **Autonomy Level** | SHOULD | Declared independence level (e.g. L1 to L5) the run is authorized to operate at; sets oversight/delegation limits. | `AOC-01`,`AOC-04`,`AOC-07` |

---

## 6. Input Handling & Trust Provenance
**Components:** `componentApplicationInputHandling`, `componentAgentInputHandling`, `componentOrchestrationInputHandling`

*The `componentAgentInputHandling` risk-map definition is literally "processing distinguishing trusted user commands from untrusted environmental data." That distinction is the single most important agentic-security signal, and the working draft did not capture it explicitly.*

| Field | Cls | Capture (concept) | Evidence |
| :------------ | :---- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------- |
| **Model Input** | MUST | Every input to each model call in the loop, user prompts, tool outputs, retrieved context, inter-agent messages. Not just the first user turn. Includes size/shape (large or repetitive inputs). | `IR-01`,`IR-02`,`TA-01`,`AOC-03`,`AOC-12`,`TA-05`,`TA-10` |
| **Input Source / Channel** | MUST | Provenance label for each input segment: which surface/tool/agent/document it came from. | `TA-01`,`AOC-10`,`AOC-12`,`IR-03` |
| **Input Trust Classification** | MUST | Whether a segment is *trusted instruction* vs *untrusted data* (owner command vs environmental/third-party content). | `AOC-02`,`AOC-08`,`AOC-12`,`TA-01`,`IR-01` |
| **Source host / IP + request metadata** | MUST | Origin of the request; supports geo/impossible-travel, rate-limit, and credential-theft detection. | `AOC-08`,`AOC-15`,`IR-04`,`TA-03`,`TA-10` |
| **Guardrail (Input) Verdict** | MUST | Result of any input-side injection/jailbreak/PII/secret classifier: **pass / flag / block / modify**, with detector + score. | `TA-01`,`IR-01`,`AOC-12`,`TA-05` |
| **Content Modality & Attachment Identity** **[AOS]** | MUST ‡ | **Cross-cutting.** For every content-bearing field: the part type (text / file / structured data), MIME type, and for files the name, size, and content hash. Instructions that arrive as an image, PDF, or structured blob are invisible to text-only inspection and text-only logging. | `AOC-12`,`AOC-05`,`TA-05`,`TA-01` |
| **Guardrail Modification Record** **[AOS]** | SHOULD ‡ | **Cross-cutting.** When an enforcement point **rewrites rather than blocks**: masking, redacting, stripping, or rewriting a payload; record that a modification occurred, which enforcement point made it, and a before/after digest (plus a redaction map where policy permits). Applies on both the input and the output side. | `TA-01`,`AOC-12`,`AOC-03`,`IR-01` |
| **Threat Classification / ATLAS Technique Tag** | MUST † | **Cross-cutting enrichment.** On any flagged or security-relevant event, the classified technique(s) as **MITRE ATLAS `AML.Txxxx`** IDs (plus a free-text threat type). Emitted by input/output guardrails and by tool/memory/retrieval detectors alike, so every alert carries a portable, ATT&CK-aligned technique reference. | `IR-01`,`TA-01`,`TA-07`,`AOC-12` |
| **Encoded / Obfuscated Payload Indicator** | MAY | Flag + decoded form when input contains base64, image-embedded (OCR), or markup "authority" tags. | `AOC-12`,`TA-03` |

† **MUST when a detection fires** (not on every benign event). The tag is a derived classification, not raw telemetry: detection logic sets it using the [Appendix A.5](#a5-attack-inventory--mitre-atlas-technique-mapping) attack→ATLAS mapping so downstream SIEM/XDR correlation and compliance reporting can pivot on `AML.Txxxx`.

‡ **Cross-cutting fields**, listed here for convenience but applying across components, see the [classification summary](#45-classification-summary). **Guardrail Modification Record** is MUST *when a modification occurs*.

---

## 7. Output Handling, Egress & Refusals
**Components:** `componentApplicationOutputHandling`, `componentAgentOutputHandling`, `componentOrchestrationOutputHandling`

*Where damage materializes: PII leakage, exfiltration channels, harmful content, mass broadcast.*

| Field | Cls | Capture (concept) | Evidence |
| :------------ | :---- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------- |
| **Response / Model Output** | MUST | The generated output at each step. Where leakage, disclosure, verbatim training data, and embedded exfil URLs appear. | `AOC-03`,`AOC-11`,`TA-01`,`TA-03`,`TA-04`,`TA-07` |
| **Output Egress Destination** | MUST | Where output goes: recipient addresses, outbound URLs/domains, channels, file targets, broadcast scope. | `TA-01`,`TA-03`,`AOC-03`,`AOC-11`,`AOC-05` |
| **Citations / Source Attribution** **[AOS]** | MUST | The sources the agent *claims* it drew on, per output: file ID/name/URL or site URL for each citation, **plus whether each resolves to an item actually returned by a logged Retrieval Event (§11)**. Unresolvable, fabricated, or attacker-supplied citations are the signal. | `TA-01`,`TA-02`,`IR-03`,`AOC-03` |
| **Observation / Thought (reasoning trace)** | SHOULD | Chain-of-thought/observations *when the provider exposes it*. Reveals whether a harmful act was injected, misauthorized, or self-initiated. | `AOC-01`,`AOC-07`,`AOC-10`,`IR-02` |
| **Guardrail (Output) Verdict** | MUST | Output-side filter result (PII/DLP, harmful content, exfil pattern): **pass / flag / block / modify**. Modifications are recorded via the **Guardrail Modification Record** (§6). Fired detections carry the **ATLAS Technique Tag** (see §6). | `TA-01`,`AOC-03`,`IR-01` |
| **LLM Refusal** | MUST | Status + reason when the model refuses. A refusal-then-success streak signals a jailbreak in progress; an *absent* refusal on clearly policy-violating output flags a guardrail gap. | `IR-01`,`AOC-12`,`AOC-13`,`AOC-14`,`TA-03`,`TA-04`,`TA-07` |

---

## 8. The Model & Model Serving
**Components:** `componentTheModel`, `componentModelServing`, `componentModelStorage`

*Supply-chain integrity, resource/DoS signals, and pre-inference integrity.*

| Field | Cls | Capture (concept) | Evidence |
| :-------------- | :---- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- |
| **Model Name + Version** | MUST | Model and version processing the request. "Which agents used the compromised model?"; pins a model-specific vulnerability for patching. | `TA-06`,`IR-04`,`AOC-06`,`TA-04` |
| **Provider / Endpoint Identity** | MAY | Which provider/endpoint served the call. The reason the completion ended is **Stop Reason** (§5). | `AOC-06` |
| **Inference Parameters** **[AOS]** | MUST | The decoding/config parameters in force for the call: `temperature`, `top_p`/`top_k`, `max_tokens`, `stop` sequences, `seed`, and the **declared context-window size**. The runtime half of the configuration-integrity baseline that **System Prompt** (§5) covers for instructions. | `TA-04`,`TA-10`,`AOC-06`,`AOC-04` |
| **Input / Output Token Counts** | MUST | Per-call token usage, the primary resource-abuse and runaway-loop signal; max-length outputs flag extraction/DoS. | `AOC-04`,`AOC-05`,`TA-04`,`TA-10` |
| **LLM Error / Exception** | MUST | Errors that occur under adversarial conditions (overflow, malformed encoding, context exhaustion); provider-side silent failures. | `AOC-06`,`IR-01`,`TA-10` |
| **Model Provenance / Signing / Hash** | SHOULD | Signed digest / provenance of the served model artifact (supply-chain attestation). | `TA-06`,`IR-04` |
| **Pre-Forward-Pass State Digest/Vector** | MAY | Content-addressed digest (+ pooled vector) of the exact inputs to a forward pass, captured pre-inference for replay/drift detection. | `IR-02`,`AOC-10` |
| **Token Malformation / Context-Corruption Indicator** | MAY | Signal of context-induced token-entropy anomalies correlated with confabulation. | `IR-02` |

---

## 9. Tools & External Services
**Component:** `componentTools`

*The security perimeter between AI reasoning and real-world consequences. When an agent calls a tool it crosses from "thinking" to "acting."*

> **Gateways, namespaces, and multiple hops.** A tool call is frequently not a single hop. Tools and prompts commonly sit behind a **gateway or broker** that re-namespaces them, and the call may traverse several intermediaries before reaching the system that acts. Three fields carry this, and they should be read together: **Tool Name** records the name *as the agent saw it*, which is the namespaced or gateway-local name and not necessarily the name at the far end; **MCP Server Identity & Primitive** records the immediate counterparty; and **Trace Context** (§5) is what stitches the hops into one trace, propagated over MCP via `params._meta`, per [Appendix D.5](#d5-context-propagation-sampling--privacy-three-operational-traps).
>
> Two consequences. First, **the same underlying capability may appear under different names** depending on the path taken to it, so detections keyed on tool name alone will miss re-namespaced invocations; keying on the server identity and primitive as well is what makes them robust. Second, an intermediary is a **mediation boundary**, and whether it was traversed at all is the subject of **Mediation Coverage & Bypass Path** (§16); `AOC-14` is precisely an attempt to reach a capability by a path that bypasses the mediated one.

| Field | Cls | Capture (concept) | Evidence |
| :------------- | :---- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------- |
| **Tool Call I/O** | MUST | Full input params **and** output for every tool/MCP call; what the agent actually *did* vs what it was asked. Reveals credentials passed between chained calls. | `AOC-01`,`AOC-02`,`AOC-03`,`TA-01`,`TA-06`,`TA-08`,`TA-09` |
| **Tool Name** | MUST | Which capability was invoked. Detects off-manifest / sensitive-tool invocation, escalating tool sequences, and enumeration. | `AOC-02`,`AOC-10`,`IR-01`,`TA-06`,`TA-08`,`TA-09` |
| **Tool Type / Trust Boundary** | MUST | MCP (cross-network) vs internal vs direct-storage vs code-execution, different trust models & policies. | `AOC-14`,`TA-01`,`TA-06` |
| **Tool ID** | MAY | Unique tool-implementation ID for unambiguous attribution across many MCP servers. | `AOC-10` |
| **Tool Execution ID** **[AOS]** | MUST | Correlation ID minted at invocation and echoed on the result, pairing every request with its outcome. | `TA-08`,`AOC-01`,`AOC-04`,`AOC-14` |
| **Tool Definition Digest** **[AOS]** | SHOULD | Hash of the tool's **declared contract as presented at invocation time**: name, description, argument schema, output schema, plus a comparison against the approved baseline. Detects a tool whose definition mutated after approval. | `AOC-10`,`AOC-14`,`TA-06`,`AOC-09` |
| **Execution Environment / Sandbox** **[AOS]** | MUST | The isolation posture of the execution: sandbox mode (none / container / VM / WASM), language runtime and version, OS/architecture, timeout, and network-egress policy. | `TA-06`,`AOC-02`,`AOC-04`,`AOC-14` |
| **MCP Server Identity & Primitive** **[AOS]** | SHOULD | For MCP calls: server name, version, transport, and endpoint; **and which MCP primitive was exercised**: `tool`, `resource`, `prompt`, `sampling`, `elicitation`, or `roots`. | `TA-06`,`AOC-10`,`TA-01`,`AOC-09`,`TA-12`,`TA-13` |
| **Tool Error / Exception** | MUST | Failed/blocked tool calls: rejected injection args, SSRF blocks, authz boundary hits, and the probing errors that precede successful exploitation. | `TA-01`,`AOC-14`,`IR-01`,`TA-06` |
| **Tool ACL / Required Scope** | SHOULD | The authority a tool requires and who may invoke it (the tool's security policy); individually-authorized calls that violate separation-of-duties as a chain. | `AOC-08`,`AOC-10`,`AOC-02`,`TA-06`,`TA-08`,`TA-12` |
| **Tool Privacy Classification** | MAY | Sensitivity class of data the tool touches, feeds DLP / data-flow governance. | `AOC-03`,`TA-01`,`TA-05` |
| **Tool Selection Rationale** **[AOS]** | SHOULD | The agent's stated reason for choosing *this* tool with *these* arguments, captured at the request step. Distinct from the §7 output-side reasoning trace: it is attached to the action, not the answer. | `AOC-01`,`TA-08`,`AOC-10`,`AOC-02` |

---

## 10. Memory
**Component:** `componentMemory`

*Persistent memory is a first-class attack surface. Multiple corpus attacks target it directly.*

> **What counts as memory, and at what granularity.** *Memory* here means **any store the agent writes to in one turn and reads back in a later one**, whatever its substrate: a vector store, a scratchpad file, a database row, a project instruction file, or a file the agent edits in a repository it also reads from. The substrate is irrelevant; the read-after-write-across-turns property is what creates the attack surface, because it is what lets `IR-02` and `AOC-10` outlive the session that planted them.
>
> The fields below are specified at **item granularity, not store granularity**: a Memory Write Event describes one item, and **Memory Provenance** attaches to that item. This requires a stable item identifier, and deployments whose memory is an opaque blob (a single file rewritten wholesale) cannot supply one. Such deployments should emit the write event with a **content digest** in place of an item ID, which preserves change detection and correlation while losing per-item provenance. That is a real reduction in detection capability and the reason item-level identity is worth engineering for.
>
> **Out of scope:** the durability, consistency, and retention semantics of the store itself, and any judgement about whether a given design *should* persist state. This section records what was written, read, and by what authority, not whether the memory architecture is sound.

| Field | Cls | Capture (concept) | Evidence |
| :---------------- | :---- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------ |
| **Memory Write Event** | MUST | Every create/update/delete to persistent or long-term memory: what changed, by which turn/actor. | `IR-02`,`IR-05`,`AOC-07`,`AOC-10` |
| **Memory Read / Injection Event** | MUST | Which memory items were pulled into context for a call. | `IR-02`,`IR-05`,`AOC-10` |
| **Memory Provenance / Source** | MUST | Origin & mutability of a memory item, self-authored, owner, non-owner, or **externally editable resource**. | `AOC-10`,`IR-02` |
| **Memory Integrity / Poisoning Signal** | SHOULD | Integrity check / poisoning-likelihood score, cross-session isolation flag. | `IR-02`,`IR-05` |
| **Memory Footprint / Growth** | MUST | Size/growth of memory stores (per user/session), resource-exhaustion signal. | `AOC-05`,`AOC-04` |
| **Declared Memory Configuration** **[AOS]** | MAY | The memory store's declared identity and limits: name, type, backend, size cap, retention, and retrieval spec (top-k, scoring). The baseline that **Memory Footprint** is measured against. | `AOC-05`,`AOC-07`,`IR-02` |
| **Memory Write Rationale** **[AOS]** | SHOULD | The agent's stated reason for persisting *this* item, captured at the write step. | `IR-02`,`AOC-07`,`AOC-10` |

---

## 11. Retrieval & Content (RAG)
**Component:** `componentRAGContent`

*RAG is a primary injection and manipulation channel.*

| Field | Cls | Capture (concept) | Evidence |
| :-------------------- | :---- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------- |
| **Retrieval Event** | MUST | Query issued + documents/chunks returned + retrieval scores. | `TA-01`,`TA-02`,`TA-09`,`IR-03`,`AOC-10` |
| **Retrieved-Content Source / Provenance** | MUST | Origin, owner, trust level, and freshness (create/update time) of each retrieved item (internal doc, web, third-party, user upload). | `TA-01`,`TA-02`,`TA-09`,`IR-03` |
| **Retrieved-Content / Metadata Integrity Signal** | SHOULD | Tamper/poisoning indicators on content **or its metadata/tags**. | `IR-03`,`IR-05`,`TA-02`,`TA-09` |
| **Declared Knowledge-Source Configuration** **[AOS]** | MAY | Each knowledge source's declared identity and contract: name, description, index/collection identity, schema, and search parameters (top-k, filters, scoring, reranker). | `TA-09`,`IR-03`,`TA-02` |

---

## 12. Orchestration, Multi-Agent & Background Execution
**Components:** `componentReasoningCore`, `componentOrchestrationInputHandling`, `componentOrchestrationOutputHandling`

*Multi-agent and autonomous-execution telemetry: the corpus shows these are where agentic risk compounds.*

| Field | Cls | Capture (concept) | Evidence |
| :-------------- | :---- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :------------ |
| **Inter-Agent Message** | MUST | Agent→agent messages: sender, receiver, content, channel, including capability/skill transfer. | `AOC-04`,`AOC-09`,`AOC-11`,`AOC-16` |
| **A2A Task Lifecycle Event** **[AOS]** | SHOULD | Delegated-task state transitions across the A2A surface: task submitted, streamed, polled, **cancelled**, resubscribed, and **push-notification config set or changed**, which registers an outbound callback destination. | `AOC-04`,`AOC-11`,`AOC-09`,`TA-01` |
| **Peer Agent Card / Descriptor** **[AOS]** | SHOULD | The counterparty agent's declared descriptor as presented at contact: name, URL, version, provider, and advertised skills/capabilities, with change detection against prior contacts **and the outcome of any verification attempted against it** (signature checked, inspection request answered or refused, or unverified). |  `AOC-09`,`AOC-11`,`AOC-08`,`AOC-16` |
| **Background / Scheduled Task Event** | MUST | Creation/modification of cron jobs, heartbeats, daemons, or self-scheduled loops, incl. presence/absence of a termination condition. | `AOC-04`,`AOC-10` |
| **Loop / Step-Count Signal** | MUST | Steps or iterations per run vs baseline; circular agent-to-agent exchange detection. | `AOC-04`,`IR-02` |
| **Resource-Consumption Aggregate** | MUST | Per-run/agent token, compute, storage, and outbound-volume totals against a budget. | `AOC-04`,`AOC-05`,`TA-10` |
| **Task / Intent Declaration** | SHOULD | The declared purpose/task the run is authorized to pursue (for goal-drift detection). | `AOC-04`,`AOC-01`,`AOC-10` |
| **Protocol Envelope Capture** **[AOS]** | MAY | The raw MCP / A2A JSON-RPC envelope (method, id, params) alongside the interpreted fields, preserving protocol-level detail that framework-level abstraction discards. | `AOC-09`,`AOC-12`,`TA-06` |

---

## 13. Identity, Delegation & Attribution *(ODIS-aligned; mostly SHOULD)*
**Cross-cutting:** spans `componentReasoningCore`, `componentTools`, `componentModelServing` and binds them into an accountable chain.

*The "Quadruple Identity" problem: a **principal** authorizes an **agent** which (possibly via **other agents**) calls a **tool** that acts on **infrastructure**. Without identity at each hop, accountability collapses and confused-deputy attacks succeed. This is the ODIS problem space; delegation fields are **SHOULD** by the classification rule. Two of these identities already have homes in the adjacent standards and should be emitted there rather than in a private namespace: the originating principal as OpenTelemetry `audit.actor.*` (OCSF `actor.user.uid`) and the acting agent as `gen_ai.agent.*` (OCSF `ai_agent.uid`). The OTel audit model has a single actor slot that its guidance fills with the human, so the acting agent must travel in `gen_ai.agent.*` to keep "who authorized" and "which agent acted" separable.*

| Field | Cls | Capture (concept) | Evidence |
| :---------- | :---- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | :---------- |
| **Identities Used (per hop)** | MUST | Attribute every agent→user, agent→agent, agent→tool, tool→infra action to an identity + metadata; detect identity changes across a tool chain. | `AOC-01`,`AOC-02`,`AOC-08`,`AOC-11`,`IR-04`,`TA-05`,`TA-08` |
| **Verified vs Displayed Identity** | MUST | Distinguish an immutable/verified identifier from a spoofable display identity; record which was used to authorize. | `AOC-08`,`AOC-11`,`AOC-15` |
| **Originating Principal (on-behalf-of)** | SHOULD | The human/service sponsor at the root of the delegation chain. | `AOC-01`,`AOC-02`,`AOC-08` |
| **Delegation Chain** | SHOULD | Ordered lineage of prior agent hops carried across the call. | `AOC-04`,`AOC-09`,`AOC-10` |
| **Granted Authorizations / Scope** | SHOULD | Delegated authority in effect at this hop, with monotonic-narrowing check. | `AOC-02`,`AOC-08`,`AOC-10`,`TA-13` |
| **Resource Indicators + Constraints** | SHOULD | Target resource audience + time/purpose/rate/locality/`data_classification` narrowing. | `AOC-03`,`AOC-05`,`TA-01` |
| **Credential Minting & Scope-Narrowing Check** **[CPEX]** | SHOULD | The credential-exchange event at each hop: grant type (token exchange / client assertion / client credentials), whose identity the minted token represents (**end user / client application / calling workload / the enforcement point itself**), target **audience**, issuer, lifetime, and the **requested-vs-granted scope delta** verified after minting. Detects both over-broad credentials and forwarded inbound tokens that were never narrowed. | `AOC-02`,`AOC-08`,`IR-04`,`TA-08` |
| **Trust-Domain Crossing & Delegation Depth** | SHOULD | The counterparty's **trust domain** and the **depth of the delegation chain** at this hop, plus whether either crossed a configured limit. Records that authority left the domain that issued it, and how many hops from the originating principal the acting agent now sits. Depth is **derived** from the chain (the OCSF `delegation.parent_uid` lineage or the RFC 8693 `act` chain), not transmitted as a counter; a transmitted copy can disagree with the chain it was derived from. | `AOC-04`,`AOC-09`,`AOC-11`,`TA-11` |
| **Runtime Credential / Attestation** | SHOULD | Runtime-instance credential: `software_hash`, `attestation_method`, issuer, expiry, holder-key binding. | `AOC-08`,`TA-06` |
| **Lifecycle State** | SHOULD | active / suspended / revoked, supports kill-switch & revocation-fanout. | `AOC-07`,`AOC-10` |

---

## 14. Asset Inventory & Fleet Aggregates *(mostly MAY)*
**Components:** `componentTools`, `componentApplication`, `componentModelFrameworksAndCode` (inventory); fleet-level metrics are cross-component.

*These define the inventory and posture rather than per-request activity. Most are governance and CVE-response signals rather than detection signals, hence mostly MAY. The exceptions are the **change** signal, which is detection-grade and MUST, and the AgBOM cluster, which is the structural counterpart to OWASP AOS's **Inspect** pillar.*

| Field / Metric | Cls | Capture (concept) | Evidence |
| :------------------------------ | :---- | :-------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| **Capability-Set Change Event** **[AOS]** | MUST | An event emitted whenever the agent's usable capability set changes at runtime, a tool, MCP server, model, knowledge source, or memory store **discovered, added, removed, or modified**: with before/after identity and what triggered the change. | `AOC-09`,`AOC-10`,`TA-06`,`AOC-02` |
| **Tool/Agent Version** | SHOULD | Version of each tool/agent/framework; instant CVE blast-radius answer; downgrade detection. | `TA-06`,`IR-04` |
| **Repository / Code Path / Software Ref** | SHOULD | Source provenance of tool/agent code (ties to signing & ODIS `approved_software_refs`). | `TA-06`,`AOC-10` |
| **AgBOM / Inventory Snapshot** **[AOS]** | SHOULD | A structured, machine-readable inventory of the agent's composition (packages, models, capabilities (agent cards, discovered peers, MCP servers), knowledge sources, memory stores, tools) emitted on change and **on demand**. Bound to an existing BOM format (CycloneDX, SPDX, or SWID) rather than a bespoke one. | `TA-06`,`IR-04`,`AOC-09`,`AOC-10` |
| **Component Dependency Graph** **[AOS]** | SHOULD | Dependency edges between inventoried components, including transitive ones; which agent depends on which tool, which tool on which package or MCP server. | `TA-06`,`IR-04` |
| **Inventory Attestation Signature** **[AOS]** | SHOULD | Cryptographic signature over the emitted inventory (signature value + key identifier), binding the declared composition to a signer. | `TA-06`,`AOC-10`,`IR-04` |
| **Description** | MAY | Declared purpose: detects misleadingly-described ("read-only" but writes) tools. | `AOC-14` |
| **Status (active/disabled)** | MAY | Detects calls to tools that should be unreachable. | `AOC-02` |
| **Creator ID / Oncall / Creation & Update dates** | MAY | Ownership, age-based risk, change-correlation for IR speed; recently-changed assets/content correlate with attack timelines. | `IR-04`,`TA-09` |
| **Surfaces Supported** | MAY | Exposure map per tool. | `AOC-08` |
| **Fleet counts** (agents by framework/type; sessions L1/L7/L28; users MAU/power-user; tool-call volume & agent↔tool map; surface & status breakdowns) | MAY | Aggregate anomaly, shadow-AI, and CVE-exposure signals. | `AOC-04`,`AOC-05`,`TA-06` |

---

## 15. Observability-Plane Integrity
**Cross-cutting:** applies to the instrumentation and enforcement layer itself, not to any one pipeline component.

*Every field in §§5 to 14 assumes the telemetry and enforcement path is functioning and uncompromised. Nothing elsewhere in the field set tests that assumption. This section closes the loop: it is telemetry **about the observability plane**, motivated by the OWASP AOS **Instrument** pillar, where enforcement is a synchronous callout that can fail, be bypassed, or be starved.*

| Field | Cls | Capture (concept) | Evidence |
| :---------------- | :---- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------- |
| **Enforcement-Point Availability & Failure Mode** | SHOULD | For each enforcement callout (guardrail, policy engine, external guardian): whether it was reached, its latency, and on failure whether the system **failed open or failed closed**, plus the action that was taken anyway. | `TA-01`,`TA-10`,`IR-01`,`AOC-12` |
| **Instrumentation Coverage / Hook Attestation** | SHOULD | Which lifecycle hooks are instrumented and active for this agent/run, and the instrumentation version, the difference between "no events" and "not observed." | `AOC-10`,`AOC-01`,`AOC-09` |
| **Event Sequence Continuity** | SHOULD | Per-session monotonic sequence number (optionally signed or chained) enabling gap and reordering detection in the event stream. | `AOC-01`,`AOC-10`,`AOC-07` |
| **Policy Reason Code** | MAY | Machine-readable reason code(s) for an enforcement decision, alongside the existing free-text detector name and score. | `IR-01`,`AOC-12`,`TA-01` |

> **Scope note for the working group.** §15 sits on the boundary between telemetry and control-plane design, and the WG should confirm the line drawn here. The position taken is that the **outcomes** of enforcement (availability, failure mode, coverage, decision rationale) are security telemetry and belong in this document, while the **protocol** for performing enforcement (AOS's JSON-RPC hook transport, guardian-agent architecture, authentication between agent and guardian) does not. See [open question 10](#open-questions-for-the-working-group).

---

## 16. Policy Enforcement & Mediation
**Cross-cutting:** the reference-monitor layer between the agent and every capability it invokes, tools, prompts, resources, inference providers, and inter-agent methods.

*§§5 to 14 record what the agent **did**; §15 records whether the observability plane **worked**. Neither records what policy **decided**, or on what basis. This section closes that gap, and it is grounded in the [CPEX](https://contextforge-org.github.io/cpex/) threat model, whose starting assumption is stronger than this document's has been: **the LLM is the adversary**. Prompt injection can arrive through any content the model reads; an injected instruction becomes a tool call; the model has no security properties and cannot be relied on to enforce anything. Everything on the agent side of the monitor is hostile, so nothing a policy reads (and, this section argues, nothing security telemetry treats as authoritative) may originate there.*

| Field | Cls | Capture (concept) | Evidence |
| :------------- | :---- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| **Authorization Decision Record** **[CPEX]** | MUST | Per mediated operation: the terminal decision (**allow / deny**, with **allow-after-modification** flagged), the deny **reason and machine-readable code** (a fail-closed enforcement failure arrives as a deny with its own code), the per-step actions that produced it including any **suppressed deny** (a plugin denied and was overridden by pipeline role) and any **abort**, the **deciding authority** (inline policy rule vs external PDP, and which; Cedar / CEL / OPA / custom), the **rule or policy identifier** that produced it, and any obligations attached. Distinct from a content-guardrail verdict: this is the *authorization* outcome, not a classifier score. | `AOC-02`,`AOC-08`,`AOC-10`,`TA-08`,`TA-12`,`TA-13` |
| **Attribute Source / Trusted-Provenance Marking** **[CPEX]** | MUST ‡ | **Cross-cutting.** For every security-relevant attribute, the **authority that supplied it**: verified IdP token, policy decision point, enforcement-owned session store, platform/runtime, versus **self-asserted by the agent or model**. Under assume-breach, an unmarked value is an unverified value. | `AOC-01`,`AOC-08`,`AOC-10`,`AOC-15` |
| **Session Taint Labels & Information-Flow Decisions** **[CPEX]** | SHOULD | Information-flow labels in force for the session or message: which labels are set, **scope** (session vs message), what operation applied each, and (critically) when an operation is **denied because of accumulated taint rather than anything in its own payload**. The write-down record. | `AOC-03`,`TA-01`,`TA-02`,`TA-05` |
| **Human Approval / Elicitation Event** **[CPEX]** | SHOULD | Out-of-band approval lifecycle for high-impact actions: correlation ID, status (pending / resolved / expired), outcome, **approver identity as verified by the identity provider** (not as reported by the agent), channel, and the **scope-binding validation result**: whether the approval still covers the arguments actually presented at execution time. | `AOC-01`,`AOC-02`,`AOC-07`,`AOC-11` |
| **Backend / Route Restriction Decision** **[CPEX]** | SHOULD | Where an operation was allowed to execute: the candidate backend/model set, the constraint that narrowed it (region, model, site, cost tier, custom label), the selection made, and the behaviour when **no candidate qualified**. | `AOC-05`,`AOC-06`,`TA-01` |
| **Mediation Coverage & Bypass Path** **[CPEX]** | SHOULD | Whether this operation traversed a reference monitor at all, at which **placement** (inbound gateway / egress sidecar / in-process framework), and whether **unmediated paths to the same capability exist**. | `AOC-02`,`AOC-14`,`TA-06` |

‡ Cross-cutting, see the [classification summary](#45-classification-summary). Applies to the attributes a hostile agent could plausibly fabricate: identity, authorization outcome, taint state, approval status, autonomy level, task declaration, and instruction configuration.

> **Scope note.** CPEX is a *runtime*; this section takes only the **decision records it produces**, not its policy language, plugin model, or deployment architecture. The boundary matches the one drawn for AOS in [§15](#15-observability-plane-integrity): enforcement outcomes are telemetry, enforcement mechanisms are not. See [Appendix G](#appendix-g-cpex-cross-reference).

## 18. Implementation Guidance

### Maturity model (how the three tiers phase in)

Adoption sequencing within the MUST tier is in [§4.6](#46-where-to-start).

- **Tier 1, MUST (baseline detection and response): a catalogue of 47 fields across §§5 to 14 and §16.** For each deployment, the baseline is the subset applicable to the components and operations it actually implements, as defined in [§4.2](#42-classification-legend). Together the catalogue covers prompt injection, data disclosure, memory/RAG poisoning, exfiltration, resource/DoS abuse, identity spoofing, runaway multi-agent loops, and unauthorized action. Every MUST field is grounded in ≥2 corpus attacks (or in one attack where it is especially useful for **D** or **R**) and is **D- or R-dominant**. §15 contains no MUST.
- **Tier 2, SHOULD (edge-modality hardening).** Adopt the relevant cluster **as soon as you run the modality**, not on a maturity schedule. Delegated authority → all of §13 plus Tool ACL/Scope (§9). Multi-tenancy → Organization/Tenant ID (§5). A2A → task lifecycle and peer agent cards (§12). Third-party or dynamic MCP composition → tool definition digest and MCP server identity (§9). Inline enforcement that mutates payloads → Guardrail Modification Record (§6). Autonomous action → autonomy level (§5) and task/intent declaration (§12). Supply-chain attestation → model signing (§8), the AgBOM cluster (§14). Self-attesting instrumentation → §15. Information-flow control → session taint (§16). Out-of-band human approval → elicitation events (§16). Policy-driven backend selection → route restriction (§16). Token exchange → credential minting (§13). Plus the reasoning-trace and integrity-scoring fields (§§7, 9, 10, 11), which are gated by provider availability and privacy policy rather than by modality.
- **Tier 3, MAY (Q, A, and thin-evidence signals).** Fleet aggregates and static asset metadata; declared memory and knowledge configuration (§§10 to 11); provider/endpoint identity (§8); tool privacy classification (§9); protocol envelopes (§12); policy reason codes (§15); derived detector outputs already covered by a MUST (encoded-payload indicator, §6); and research-grade signals (pre-forward-pass state, token malformation, §8).

### Operationalizing telemetry for detection
Logged fields are a necessary evidentiary foundation, not detection by themselves. A four-year measurement study of a production security operations centre; 115 million alerts, 2018 to 2022; found volumes of **24 K to 134 K alerts per day of which 0.01% corresponded to true attacks or compromises**, with 27% attack attempts and 49% benign triggers [[44]](#standards--frameworks). Treat logged values as inputs to layered analytics: signature rules, self-learning anomaly detection, cross-layer correlation (the patterns above), and ML scoring of prompts/outputs/action-sequences. The corollary is a staffing one, and it is the reason this document orders fields by detection value rather than completeness: a trail no analyst can read is not an asset. Field names, tier, and the [correlation patterns](#17-correlation-patterns) are meant to be usable directly as detection-engineering and triage input, and the attack IDs on every field are there so an analyst can see what a field was collected *for*. Continuously re-evaluate detectors; benchmarks show injection detectors effective on explicit attacks often fail on subtler variants. **When a detector fires, stamp the event with its MITRE ATLAS `AML.Txxxx` technique** (the *Threat Classification / ATLAS Technique Tag* field) using the [Appendix A.5](#a5-attack-inventory--mitre-atlas-technique-mapping) mapping; this makes AI-specific alerts correlate with the ATT&CK-aligned rest of the SOC and roll up cleanly into ATLAS-based compliance reporting.

### Privacy-preserving logging
**Model Input, Response, System Prompt, Observation/Thought, Memory, and Retrieved Content** carry significant privacy weight (they can contain PII/secrets, see `AOC-03`). Apply: access controls restricting content-log access to IR with justification; short retention for full content (7 to 30 days) and longer retention for hashed/classified signals; redaction pipelines that strip PII while keeping content hashes for correlation; encryption at rest with audited key access. This is why several high-value fields (Observation/Thought, memory/RAG content) are captured *conceptually* here but their raw-content logging is a deployment policy decision.

## Appendix A: Attack & Incident Inventory

> **Reading the tables.** The *detecting fields* named in each row are defined in §§5 to 16, with what to capture and their tier; [§4.5](#45-classification-summary) is the index. The *primary components* are CoSAI Risk Map component IDs ([§4.3](#43-component-taxonomy)), given here without the `component` prefix.

Normalized catalogue of the attacks and incidents referenced above. Each row lists the telemetry the incident makes necessary and the primary risk-map component(s) involved.

### A.1 Real-world attack vectors

The catalogue of documented, real-world attacks, each mapped to the CoSAI telemetry fields that detect it, ordered so that the lead case study comes first:

- **`TA-01`: EchoLeak** is the document's lead public case study and the first entry in the catalogue. It is included here because it is the most complete public example of the attack class this schema exists to make visible (a zero-click, retrieval-mediated, classifier-bypassing exfiltration chain) and because its own post-incident guidance is the telemetry argument this document opens with. Its detecting-field list is derived here.
- **`TA-11…13`** are MCP-mediated incidents, surfaced by CoSAI's **MCP Security** paper (WS4) and cited here to their primary sources. They enter the corpus because they supply documented instances of attack classes the field set otherwise rests on analogical grounding for: cross-tenant leakage and MCP-mediated privilege escalation. Their detecting-field lists are derived here.
- **`TA-02…10`** are the authoritative catalogue, reproduced with their original detecting-field lists so the fields above can cite them by ID.

### A.4 Attack taxonomy: CoSAI `AT10xx` codes (deprecated aliases to MITRE ATLAS)

**Migration table.** The `AT10xx` codes are the informal technique labels used by the AI-Incident-Response case studies. **[MITRE ATLAS](https://atlas.mitre.org/) `AML.Txxxx` is canonical and `AT10xx` is deprecated.** This table exists so that existing CoSAI material can be read and migrated; **do not use the left-hand column in new work or in emitted telemetry.** Read it left-to-right once, then use ATLAS.

ATLAS is community-maintained, versioned, and ATT&CK-aligned, and is a first-class compliance framework in AITF via `compliance.framework = mitre_atlas`, so a tagged event correlates with existing SOC tooling without translation.

## Appendix B: Mapping to the CoSAI Risk Map (risks & controls)

*Does this telemetry work imply changes to the [CoSAI Risk Map](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/secure-ai-tooling/tree/main/risk-map)?* The risk map has expanded considerably, from 36 risks and 37 controls to **55 risks and 68 controls**, and the expansion, driven largely by review of CoSAI's [MCP Security paper](https://www.coalitionforsecureai.org/wp-content/uploads/2026/03/model-context-protocol-security-1.pdf) (WS4, approved 8 January 2026), lands directly on the agentic surface this document instruments. Every risk and control this field set requires is present in the risk map, so this appendix is a mapping rather than a set of asks. What remains open is a small number of component and control refinements, in [B.3](#b3-component--control-refinements).

> **Version basis.** This mapping is built against the risk map with PR [#507](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/secure-ai-tooling/pull/507) merged, plus `riskAgentMemoryPoisoning`, `riskDeceptiveAgentReporting`, `riskUnsafeInterAgentPropagation` and `controlAgentMemoryIntegrity`: **55 risks and 68 controls**. Risk IDs use the `risk` + camelCase convention. Verify IDs against `main`.

### B.1 Controls this telemetry operationalizes

This document is, in effect, the implementation spec for the risk map's **detection and observability** controls; those that require logging without specifying fields:

- **`controlAgentObservability`**: "an agent's actions, tool use, and reasoning are transparent and auditable through logging." → §§5, 7, 9, 12, 13 fields.
- **`controlThreatDetection`**: detect and alert on attacks against AI assets. → all MUST fields + the [ATLAS Technique Tag](#a5-attack-inventory--mitre-atlas-technique-mapping).
- **`controlAuditTrailCompleteness`**: → **Instrumentation Coverage / Hook Attestation** (§15) is the field that evidences completeness rather than asserting it.
- **`controlAuditTrailIntegrityVerification`**: → **Event Sequence Continuity** (§15).
- **`controlAIInfrastructureObservability`**: → §§8, 12, 14 resource, loop, and inventory signals.
- **`controlAgentMemoryIntegrity`**: provenance, integrity and isolation of persistent memory. → §10 **Memory Write Event**, **Memory Read / Injection Event** and **Memory Provenance / Source**, the field that separates a legitimate write from an implant.
- **`controlIncidentResponseManagement`**: post-incident forensics. → content, tool I/O, identity, memory and retrieval provenance.
- **`controlVulnerabilityManagement`**, **`controlRiskGovernance`**, **`controlAIComponentPatchManagement`**: fleet monitoring and residual-risk measurement. → §14 aggregates, version and provenance.

**Recommendation:** have `controlAgentObservability`, `controlThreatDetection`, the audit-trail controls and `controlAgentMemoryIntegrity` reference this field set **by tier** as their normative telemetry schema, rather than each deployment reinventing it.

### B.2 Telemetry cluster → risk → control

### B.3 Component & control refinements

- **No new pipeline components required.** `componentMemory` and `componentRAGContent` exist. Two clarifications stand: confirm `componentMemory` scope explicitly covers *persistent long-term* memory, which `riskAgentMemoryPoisoning` targets; and note that **background and scheduled execution** (heartbeats, cron, self-scheduled loops; §12) still has no dedicated component, despite being a distinct autonomy surface (`AOC-04`, `AOC-10`).
- **Identity and delegation is now well covered by controls.** The recommendation to document an identity/delegation control-plane view is largely satisfied by `controlComponentIdentityAuthentication`, `controlComponentIdentityRegistration`, `controlDelegatedAuthorizationIntegrity`, `controlDelegatedAuthorityConfinement`, and `controlSenderConstrainedCredentials`. §13 telemetry now has an explicit home.
- **`controlAuditRecordRepositoryIndependence` intersects this document's stated scope boundary.** [§3.2](#32-not-in-scope) excludes securing the telemetry pipeline and defers it to subsequent work. That control now names part of the problem (repository independence from the workload being recorded) which strengthens the case for taking the deferred work up, and gives it a control to map onto when it is.
- **Augment `controlThreatDetection`** to require the **ATLAS technique tag** on emitted detections, tying this appendix to [Appendix E](#appendix-e-implications-for-ocsf--aitf-the-standardization-bridge).

## Appendix C: AITF & ODIS Cross Reference

Maps each conceptual field to the [AITF](https://github.com/cosai-oasis/ws2-defenders/tree/main/telemetry) attribute namespace and to the relevant [ODIS](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OGlaIAPu_I9RT0YqSF_li3dQEULAW6eo/edit) data-model field. Per the brief, ODIS coverage is **selective**: it targets the delegation/identity fields relevant to detection & response, not the full ODIS spec.

> **The `Cls` column is reproduced from the [classification summary](#45-classification-summary) for convenience and is not normative.** [§4.5](#45-classification-summary) and the section tables in §§5 to 16 govern; any disagreement between them and this column is a defect in this table.

> **Note on the identifier mapping.** §5 distinguishes five levels (instance → run → session → turn → step). AITF maps the runtime instance to `gen_ai.agent.id` and the session to `gen_ai.conversation.id`; the run maps to the trace ID. AITF has no dedicated turn attribute today. Step identity is the OTel `span_id`, with `gen_ai.agent.step.index` recording its order within the agent sequence; see [Appendix F.4](#f4-what-this-implies-for-opentelemetry-aitf-and-ocsf).

> **Note on upstream OTel coverage.** The **OpenTelemetry GenAI conventions** moved to a dedicated repository and cover more of this field set than is commonly assumed (notably `gen_ai.system_instructions` (System Prompt), `gen_ai.tool.definitions` (Tool Definition Digest), `gen_ai.retrieval.query.text` / `.documents` (Retrieval Event), the full `gen_ai.request.*` decoding set (Inference Parameters), the `mcp.*` namespace (MCP Server Identity), and `gen_ai.invoke_agent.tool_calls` / `.inference_calls` (Loop Signal, as metrics)). See **[Appendix D.1](#d1-what-the-genai-conventions-cover-today)** for the inventory and **[D.2](#d2-coverage--gaps-by-field-cluster)** for what remains genuinely absent: chiefly trust classification, security guardrail verdicts, retrieval provenance, and (within an otherwise-covered `gen_ai.memory.*` namespace) memory provenance and footprint.

> **ODIS fields intentionally out of telemetry scope** (identity/authority mechanics rather than detection signals): `approved_runtime_issuers`, `trust_domain`, `policy_profile_ref`, `permitted_delegation_modes`, `provider_entitlements`, and the cryptographic details of `binding_profile` (DPoP/mTLS/TLS-session). These are consumed by the policy engine (ODIS §6.4 Identity Context) rather than emitted as security telemetry, `trust_domain` and `max_depth` are the exception: §13's **Trust-Domain Crossing & Delegation Depth** field carries them as telemetry, because both become detection-grade once a delegation chain leaves the domain that issued it (see [§4.7](#47-agents-you-do-not-operate)).

## Appendix D: Implications for OpenTelemetry (the instrumentation bridge)

This appendix covers the OpenTelemetry emission side of the standards bridge; [Appendix E](#appendix-e-implications-for-ocsf--aitf-the-standardization-bridge) covers OCSF consumption. AITF carries the interim binding between them, so the proposals should be sequenced together.

**Scope of the ask.** OpenTelemetry is not a security telemetry framework and should not become one. Its GenAI conventions are shaped by observability concerns, latency, cost, token accounting, evaluation quality, and that is the right centre of gravity. The argument here is narrower and, in this document's view, uncontroversial: **OTel's ubiquity means it is where AI instrumentation is being written**, so the subset of security-relevant fields that map cleanly onto its existing model should be added to the specification, so that deployments already running OTel get them by default rather than by bespoke effort. Fields that do not map cleanly, such as authorization decisions, delegation chains, and information-flow labels, are noted as such and left to OCSF and the [AOS](#appendix-f-owasp-aos-cross-reference) / [CPEX](#appendix-g-cpex-cross-reference) surfaces. **This appendix asks OTel to cover what OTel is already shaped to cover, and no more.**

> **Verification note.** The GenAI conventions **moved** out of the main `open-telemetry/semantic-conventions` repository into a dedicated **`open-telemetry/semantic-conventions-genai`** repository; the attributes still listed in the main registry are marked *Deprecated* to reflect that relocation, not abandonment. Every convention cited below carries **Status: Development**: none is stable, which is precisely why this is the moment to contribute. Names were read from the live registry and docs at the time of writing; re-verify before filing.

### D.1 What the GenAI conventions cover today

The conventions are richer than is commonly assumed, and several fields in fact have a natural OTel home already.

- **Spans.** `chat`, `text_completion`, `embeddings`, `generate_content`, `execute_tool`, `create_agent`, `invoke_agent` (client and internal variants), `invoke_workflow`, and a **`plan`** span, discriminated by `gen_ai.operation.name`.
- **Core attributes.** `gen_ai.provider.name`; `gen_ai.agent.id` / `.name` / `.description` / `.version`; `gen_ai.conversation.id`; `gen_ai.workflow.name`; `gen_ai.request.model` and the full decoding set (`temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, `max_tokens`, `stop_sequences`, `seed`, `frequency_penalty`, `presence_penalty`, `choice.count`, `stream`); `gen_ai.response.id` / `.model` / `.finish_reasons`; `gen_ai.usage.input_tokens` / `.output_tokens` / `.reasoning.output_tokens` / `.cache_read.input_tokens` / `.cache_creation.input_tokens`.
- **Content and definitions.** `gen_ai.input.messages`, `gen_ai.output.messages`, **`gen_ai.system_instructions`**, **`gen_ai.tool.definitions`**, `gen_ai.tool.name` / `.description` / `.type` / `.call.id` / `.call.arguments` / `.call.result`, `gen_ai.output.type`, `gen_ai.prompt.name`.
- **Retrieval.** **`gen_ai.retrieval.query.text`**, **`gen_ai.retrieval.documents`**, `gen_ai.data_source.id`, `gen_ai.embeddings.dimension.count`.
- **Memory.** A **`gen_ai.memory.*`** namespace: `store.id`, `record.id`, `record.count`, `query.text`, `records`, with a `MemoryRecord` schema (`content`, `id`, `metadata`, `score`); seven memory operations on `gen_ai.operation.name` (`create_memory`, `create_memory_store`, `delete_memory`, `delete_memory_store`, `search_memory`, `update_memory`, `upsert_memory`); and a **`gen_ai.memory.client`** span, already implemented by `aws-bedrock-agentcore` and `google-adk`.
- **Evaluation.** A `gen_ai.evaluation.result` event with `gen_ai.evaluation.name`, `.score.value`, `.score.label`, `.explanation`.
- **Metrics.** `gen_ai.client.operation.duration`, `gen_ai.client.token.usage`, `gen_ai.client.operation.time_to_first_chunk` / `.time_per_output_chunk`, `gen_ai.execute_tool.duration`, **`gen_ai.invoke_agent.duration` / `.inference_calls` / `.tool_calls`**, `gen_ai.invoke_workflow.duration`, `gen_ai.server.request.duration` / `.time_to_first_token` / `.time_per_output_token`.
- **MCP.** A distinct **`mcp.*`** namespace: `mcp.method.name`, `mcp.protocol.version`, `mcp.request.id`, `mcp.resource.uri`, `mcp.session.id`, plus `mcp.client.operation.duration`, `mcp.server.operation.duration`, and client/server `session.duration` metrics.

Three existing GenAI attributes already close gaps this document had left open. `gen_ai.system_instructions` gives **System Prompt** (§5) a home. `gen_ai.tool.definitions` gives **Tool Definition Digest** (§9) one; the raw material for a digest is already in scope, and only the *hash-and-compare* is missing. And `gen_ai.invoke_agent.tool_calls` / `.inference_calls` are already the shape of **Loop / Step-Count Signal** (§12) and part of **Resource-Consumption Aggregate** (§12), as metrics rather than attributes.

### D.2 Coverage & gaps, by field cluster

Where each cluster lands in OTel **today**, the gap, and the recommended change. Clusters are grouped by pipeline component; the tier tag records which tiers the identified gap spans, not the full tier mix of the underlying section.

| Field cluster (tier) | OTel today | Gap | Recommended OTel change |
| :---------- | :------------------ | :--------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| Execution context & agent identity (MUST / SHOULD) | `gen_ai.agent.*`, `gen_ai.conversation.id`, `gen_ai.workflow.name`; span hierarchy | No turn/step identifier; no trigger type; no tenant; no surface | Add `gen_ai.turn.id` / `gen_ai.step.id`; `gen_ai.trigger.type` (`user_initiated` / `autonomous`) + `gen_ai.trigger.event`; adopt existing tenant/resource attrs |
| Prompt / response / system prompt (MUST) | `gen_ai.input.messages`, `gen_ai.output.messages`, `gen_ai.system_instructions` | **Covered.** Gated behind content-capture opt-in | Keep; ensure a **hash-only** capture mode exists (see [D.5](#d5-context-propagation-sampling--privacy-three-operational-traps)) |
| Content modality & attachments (MUST) | Message parts carry types | No attachment name/size/**hash** | Add attachment identity attrs on message parts; hash especially, as it survives redaction |
| Input trust classification (MUST) | n/a | **No trust-provenance concept at all** | Add `gen_ai.input.trust_level` (trusted-instruction / trusted-data / untrusted-data / adversarial-suspected) per message part |
| Guardrail verdicts (MUST) | `gen_ai.evaluation.*`: quality-oriented | No security guardrail verdict, blocked flag, or threat classification | **Extend the evaluation event for security use**, or add `gen_ai.guardrail.*` (type, verdict, score, blocked, threat technique), see [D.3](#d3-what-cosai-asks-opentelemetry-to-include) item 2 |
| Citations (MUST) | `gen_ai.retrieval.documents` exists | Output-side citations not linked to retrieved items | Add citation attrs on output messages with a resolution flag against retrieval |
| Model & serving (SHOULD) | `gen_ai.request.*` decoding set, `gen_ai.provider.name`, `gen_ai.response.*` | **Inference Parameters fully covered.** No model provenance/signing | Add `gen_ai.model.hash` / `.signature` / `.source` (supply-chain) |
| Token counts & resource aggregates (MUST) | `gen_ai.client.token.usage`, `gen_ai.invoke_agent.*` metrics | **Largely covered** | Add per-run budget/threshold semantics; document security use of the loop metrics |
| Tools & MCP (MUST / SHOULD) | `gen_ai.tool.*` incl. `definitions` and `call.id`; full `mcp.*` namespace | No tool-definition **digest**; no MCP **primitive** discriminator; no sandbox/isolation attrs | Add `gen_ai.tool.definitions.hash`; add an `mcp.primitive` value set (tool / resource / prompt / sampling / elicitation / roots), `mcp.method.name` partially serves; add execution-environment attrs (`sandbox`, runtime, egress policy) |
| Memory (MUST) | **`gen_ai.memory.*`**: `store.id`, `record.id`, `record.count`, `query.text`, `records`; seven memory operations on `gen_ai.operation.name`; a `gen_ai.memory.client` span | Operation and item identity are **covered**. No **provenance** and no **footprint** attribute exists anywhere in the `gen_ai` registry | Add **provenance** and **footprint** attributes to the existing `gen_ai.memory.*` namespace |
| Retrieval / RAG (MUST / SHOULD) | `gen_ai.retrieval.query.text`, `.documents`, `gen_ai.data_source.id` | No per-item **source/provenance**, freshness, or integrity signal | Add provenance and last-modified attrs to retrieval document entries |
| Output egress (MUST) | n/a | No link from model output to destination | Correlate via existing HTTP/network semconv on the child span; document the pattern |
| Orchestration & multi-agent (MUST) | `invoke_agent`, `invoke_workflow`, `plan` spans; agent metrics | No inter-agent message attrs; no background-task/termination-condition signal | Add inter-agent messaging attrs; treat scheduled/self-triggered runs via `gen_ai.trigger.type` |
| Identity & delegation (SHOULD) | n/a | No principal, delegation chain, scope, or attestation | **Out of natural scope for OTel**: carry via OCSF Authentication/Delegation; see [D.3](#d3-what-cosai-asks-opentelemetry-to-include) note |
| Asset inventory & AgBOM (MUST / SHOULD) | Resource attributes, partially | No capability-change event; no BOM reference | Add a capability-change event; reference an external BOM by URI/digest rather than embedding it |
| Policy enforcement & mediation (MUST / SHOULD) | n/a | No authorization decision, taint, approval, or attribute-provenance concept | **Out of natural scope for OTel**: carry via OCSF `ai_authorization` / `ai_taint` / `ai_approval` ([E.2](#e2-what-cosai-asks-ocsf-to-include-summary)) |
| Observability-plane integrity (SHOULD) | n/a | No enforcement-availability or instrumentation-coverage representation | Partially natural: OTel can record hook coverage as a resource attribute; enforcement outcomes belong to OCSF |

### D.3 What CoSAI asks OpenTelemetry to include

Ordered by ratio of security value to specification cost. Every item is scoped to something OTel already models, and the two clusters that are *not* a natural fit are named as such rather than pushed.

1. **A trust-provenance attribute on message parts.** `gen_ai.input.trust_level`, distinguishing trusted instruction from untrusted environmental data. This is the single highest-value addition and the one with no current analogue anywhere in the conventions. It is cheap (an enum on an existing structure) and it is the field the CoSAI Risk Map treats as the core agentic control (§6).
2. **A security-guardrail signal, ideally by extending `gen_ai.evaluation.*`.** The evaluation event already carries name, score, label, and explanation, the right shape for a classifier verdict. What it lacks is the security semantics: a **blocked / allowed** outcome, a guardrail **type**, and a **threat technique** reference. Reusing evaluation avoids a parallel namespace; the alternative is a dedicated `gen_ai.guardrail.*`. Either way, this is the field that makes classifier *bypass* detectable (`TA-01`).
3. **Memory provenance and footprint, on the existing `gen_ai.memory.*` namespace.** `gen_ai.memory.*` carries store and record identity, query text, record count, seven memory operations and a `gen_ai.memory.client` span ([D.1](#d1-what-the-genai-conventions-cover-today)). Operation and item identity are therefore covered; **provenance** and **footprint** are not, and neither appears anywhere in the `gen_ai` registry. Memory remains a MUST cluster here (§10), with `IR-02` and `IR-05` as direct grounding and `AOC-05` for footprint.
4. **Retrieval provenance.** `gen_ai.retrieval.documents` exists; per-document **source, owner, trust level, and last-modified** do not, and `TA-09` turns specifically on recently-modified retrievable content.
5. **Turn and step identifiers.** `gen_ai.conversation.id` and `gen_ai.workflow.name` exist; the intermediate levels do not. `TA-08` and `IR-01` are across-turn patterns (§5).
6. **`gen_ai.trigger.type` and `gen_ai.trigger.event`.** Whether a run was user-initiated or autonomous, and what event started it. `TA-01` is zero-click; this is the first filter of any injection hunt.
7. **Tool-definition digest and MCP primitive discriminator.** `gen_ai.tool.definitions` and `mcp.method.name` already carry the raw material; a stable hash attribute and an explicit primitive value set make definition drift and non-tool MCP surfaces queryable (§9).
8. **Attachment identity on content parts**: name, size, and hash. `AOC-12` is an image/OCR injection; `AOC-05` is attachment flooding.
9. **Model provenance attributes**: hash, signature, source, completing the supply-chain story that `gen_ai.request.model` starts.

**Two clusters this document deliberately does *not* ask OTel to adopt.** **Identity and delegation** (§13) and **policy enforcement** (§16) are authorization-domain concerns with mature homes elsewhere, OCSF Authentication, and the proposed `ai_authorization` / `ai_taint` / `ai_approval` objects in [E.2](#e2-what-cosai-asks-ocsf-to-include-summary). Pushing them into OTel would duplicate schema and invite drift. The one exception worth raising is **correlation**: an OTel span should be able to reference an authorization decision by ID so the two layers join at query time, which is a single attribute rather than a namespace. Two identity facts do have OTel homes and should be emitted there rather than in a private namespace: the originating principal as `audit.actor.id` / `audit.actor.type` (the OpenTelemetry audit data model draft, where it is MUST-level) and the acting agent as `gen_ai.agent.id` / `gen_ai.agent.name`. The OCSF transform is `actor.user.uid` and `ai_agent.uid` respectively.

### D.4 Signal selection: traces, events/logs, metrics

OTel has three signal types and OCSF has one event model, so this guidance has no counterpart in [Appendix E](#appendix-e-implications-for-ocsf--aitf-the-standardization-bridge), but getting it wrong is the most common way security telemetry becomes unusable or unaffordable.

| Signal | Use for | Fields from this document |
| :-------- | :-------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Span attributes** | Low-cardinality identifiers and the execution skeleton | Agent/instance/run/session/turn/step IDs, action type, execution status, model and provider, tool name and type, trigger type, trust level, decision references |
| **Events / logs** | Content and anything high-cardinality, large, or privacy-bearing | Prompts, responses, system instructions, tool arguments and results, memory operations, retrieved documents, citations, guardrail verdicts, capability-change events |
| **Metrics** | Aggregates, budgets, and rate-based detections | Token usage, loop and step counts, tool-call rates, resource aggregates, guardrail block rates, deny rates |

Signal choice matters. The following rules correct mistakes that show up often when GenAI instrumentation is reused for security:

- **Never put content in span attributes.** Prompts, responses, and tool results are unbounded in size and often contain PII. OTel already models them as event bodies; keep them there. A span attribute carrying a full prompt breaks cardinality limits and leaks into every trace backend that samples the span.
- **Emit detection-relevant aggregates as metrics, not as derived queries.** Loop counts and token budgets (§12) are cheap as metrics and expensive as trace aggregations, and metrics survive sampling, which traces may not.
- **Cross-reference rather than duplicate.** A guardrail verdict event should carry the span and trace IDs, not a copy of the prompt it evaluated.

### D.5 Context propagation, sampling & privacy: three operational traps

**Propagation is solved for MCP, and the mechanism should be adopted deliberately.** The MCP conventions specify that instrumentations SHOULD inject context into the MCP request **`params._meta`** property bag, with `traceparent`, `tracestate`, and `baggage` written unprefixed per **SEP-414**, and that the receiver uses the extracted context as the remote parent. That is exactly the mechanism **Trace Context (propagated)** (§5) requires, and it means cross-hop correlation over MCP is a matter of configuration rather than invention. Two cautions. First, HTTP-level propagation covers the HTTP request but **not** individual messages within a streaming request/response, a gap that matters for long-lived agent sessions. Second, and more important for security: **`baggage` crosses the trust boundary.** It is attacker-influenceable in exactly the way §16's provenance rule describes, so baggage may carry correlation identifiers but **must never carry trust levels, authorization decisions, taint labels, or identity claims**. Those come from the enforcement point, not from the wire.

**Sampling is the trap most likely to silently defeat this entire field set.** OTel's default is head-based sampling at some fraction of traces. Applied to security telemetry, that means *most attacks are simply not recorded*. Worse, the sample is drawn without regard to whether an event is security-relevant, so a guardrail block has the same chance of being discarded as a routine completion. Three requirements follow, and this document treats them as **normative for any deployment relying on OTel as its security-telemetry carrier**:

1. **Security-relevant events must not be head-sampled.** Guardrail verdicts, refusals, tool errors, authorization denials, capability changes, session and turn stop events carrying a **Stop Reason** (§5), per-invocation tool activity events, and any event carrying a fired detection are recorded at **100%**. A sampled-away `content_filter` stop is a missed guardrail bypass.
2. **Where tail sampling is used, security relevance must be a retention predicate**: a trace containing a block, a denial, an error, or a flagged classification is always kept.
3. **The sampling configuration in force is itself telemetry.** A detection that never fires because its input was sampled away is indistinguishable from a clean environment. This is the same failure mode as fail-open enforcement ([§15](#15-observability-plane-integrity)) and deserves the same treatment.

**Privacy: content capture is opt-in, and that default is correct.** GenAI instrumentations gate message content behind an explicit capture setting, which aligns with this document's [privacy-preserving logging](#18-implementation-guidance) position. The gap is that capture is close to binary (on or off) where security work needs a **middle setting**: hashes and classifications without raw content, so that correlation (same payload across many sessions, same attachment hash) survives even where raw capture is prohibited. That is [D.3](#d3-what-cosai-asks-opentelemetry-to-include) item 1's companion ask, and it is the OTel expression of this document's **hash-first** principle. The OTel Collector is also the correct place to run redaction, since it applies uniformly across every instrumented service rather than per-library.

**Canonicalization is a prerequisite for hash-first, and it must be declared.** A content hash or an event fingerprint correlates across producers only if every producer hashes the same logical bytes. The OpenTelemetry audit data model draft mandates RFC 8785 (JCS); OCSF's `attestation.fingerprint` instead *declares* its serialization (`serialization_id` plus a free-text `serialization`) so that non-JCS producers can say so honestly; CPEX's audit seam ([cpex#166](https://github.com/contextforge-org/cpex/pull/166)) hashes a sorted-key JSON that is documented as not RFC 8785. Two conformant implementations with different canonicalizations produce different digests for the same event, and the integrity claim degrades silently from "verify" to "trust the producer". Requirement: a producer that emits a hash of content or of an event MUST declare the canonicalization used (JCS by default), and consumers MUST NOT compare digests across producers whose declared canonicalizations differ. OCSF carries the declaration on `attestation.fingerprint`; the OTel-side ask is a single `audit.integrity.canonicalization` attribute.

## Appendix E: Implications for OCSF & AITF (the standardization bridge)

This appendix covers the OCSF consumption side of the standards bridge and AITF's role as the interim binding. OpenTelemetry coverage and emission-side proposals are in [Appendix D](#appendix-d-implications-for-opentelemetry-the-instrumentation-bridge).

### E.1 OCSF coverage & gaps, by field cluster

For each cluster of fields defined above: where it lands in OCSF **today**, the **gap**, the **AITF interim carrier**, and the **recommended OCSF change**. Clusters are grouped by pipeline component; the tier tag records which tiers the identified gap spans, not the full tier mix of the underlying section.

| Field cluster (tier) | OCSF today | Gap | AITF interim carrier | Recommended OCSF change |
| :------ | :---------- | :---------------------- | :---------- | :---------------------------------------------------- |
| Execution context & agent identity (MUST / SHOULD) | API Activity (6003) with the `ai_operation` profile: `ai_agent` (stable `uid`, restart-sensitive `instance_uid`, framework `type_id`, `charter`, backing `ai_model`), `delegation`, `message_context` | No workflow / run / turn / step identifiers, action type, trigger type, or autonomy level | `gen_ai.agent.*`; proposed **Agent Activity (9001)** | Ratify an **AI agent activity** class for agent-originated control-plane events (tracking [ocsf-schema#1640](https://github.com/ocsf/ocsf-schema/issues/1640); the OCSF working group agreed 2026-09-04 that Application Lifecycle is not the home); extend the `ai_operation` profile with the run / turn / step identifiers, action type, trigger type |
| Stop reason (SHOULD) | `ai_stop_reason_id` on the `ai_operation` profile ([ocsf-schema#1704](https://github.com/ocsf/ocsf-schema/pull/1704), maintainer-approved 2026-09-04): Unknown / End of Turn / Token Limit / Tool Use / Session Stop / Content Filter / Other | None once merged | `gen_ai.response.finish_reason` | Merge #1704; no further ask |
| Prompt / response / system prompt (MUST) | `message_context` on the `ai_operation` profile: `prompt_text`, `response_text`, token counts, `ai_role_id`, session `uid` | No content hash, redaction / PII flags, system prompt, or attachment identity | `gen_ai.prompt` / `gen_ai.completion` / system message | Extend **`message_context`** with `prompt_hash` / `response_hash`, `is_redacted`, `system_prompt` (+ hash), attachment identity; this is the OCSF expression of the hash-first principle. A separate `ai_content` object only if content must attach to classes other than 6003 |
| Input trust classification (MUST) | Detection Finding (2004), partial | No trust-provenance enum | `security.*` (trust/threat) | New **`trust_level`** enum (trusted-instruction / trusted-data / untrusted-data / adversarial-suspected), usable on content and message objects |
| Guardrail verdicts (MUST) | Detection Finding (2004), partial | No guardrail-verdict object | `security.guardrail.*`, `security.blocked`, `security.threat_type` | New **`ai_guardrail`** object (type, verdict, score, blocked flag, threat reference) |
| Threat classification / **ATLAS technique tag** (MUST) | Detection Finding (2004) `attacks[]`, documented as compatible with MITRE ATLAS tactics, techniques and sub-techniques; `attack.version` carries the ATLAS matrix version | None: producer guidance only | `security.threat_type` + `compliance.framework=mitre_atlas` / `compliance.control_id` | No schema change. Populate `attacks[].technique.uid` with `AML.Txxxx`, `attacks[].tactic` with the ATLAS tactic, `attacks[].version` with the ATLAS matrix version |
| Output egress (MUST) | Network / HTTP Activity (partial) | No link from model output → egress channel/recipient | `mcp.tool.call.arguments`, `security.pii.*` | Add **egress correlation** attribute on Agent Activity linking output → destination/recipient/URL |
| Model & serving (SHOULD) | API Activity (6003) model attrs; App Lifecycle (6002); Vulnerability Finding (2002) | Provenance/signing not standardized in profile | `gen_ai.request.model`, `gen_ai.provider.name`, `supply_chain.*` | Standardize model name/version/provider + **provenance/signing** attrs in `ai_operation` |
| Tools & MCP (MUST / SHOULD) | API Activity (6003) | No MCP object, tool trust-boundary, ACL/scope | `mcp.*`, `identity.auth.scope_granted` | Land **`ai_tool`** with its `mcp` sub-block, `primitive` axis and `transaction_uid` join key, drafted in [ocsf-schema#1729](https://github.com/ocsf/ocsf-schema/pull/1729); add **`tool_trust_boundary`** enum (mcp / internal / direct-storage) + scope attr to it |
| Memory (MUST / SHOULD) | Datastore Activity (6005), loosely | No memory-operation object, provenance, poisoning/isolation signals | `memory.*`, `memory.security.*` | New **`ai_memory`** object (op, provenance, footprint, poisoning score, isolation-verified) |
| Retrieval / RAG (MUST / SHOULD) | Datastore Activity (6005) | No retrieved-content source/provenance/integrity | `rag.*` | New **`ai_retrieval`** object (query, items, source/provenance, integrity signal) |
| Orchestration & multi-agent (MUST) | None native | No inter-agent message, background task, loop/step, resource aggregate | Proposed **Agent Activity (9001)**; inter-agent via 9002 | Ratify **AI Agent Activity (9001)** carrying inter-agent, background-task, loop, and resource-aggregate attrs |
| Identity & delegation (SHOULD) | `delegation` object on the `ai_operation` profile: durable authorization context with `uid` minted by a trusted issuer, `parent_uid` lineage, `issuer_uid`, `created_time`; Authentication (3002) for the credential events | No granted scope / constraints, runtime credential attestation, trust-domain crossing, lifecycle state; depth is derivable by walking `parent_uid` | `identity.*`; proposed **Delegation Activity (9002)** | Extend **`delegation`** with scope, constraints, lifecycle state; ratify **AI Delegation Activity (9002)** for the control-plane lifecycle (tracking [ocsf-schema#1640](https://github.com/ocsf/ocsf-schema/issues/1640)); add a **`runtime_attestation`** object (not `ai_attestation`: `attestation` already exists in OCSF and means record integrity); align to the ODIS delegation record at concept level |
| Asset inventory & fleet (SHOULD / MAY) | Inventory Info (partial) | No AI-asset object; fleet aggregates derived | `asset.*` | New **`ai_asset`** object (version, software ref, ownership, status); the agent trust-base half of this is proposed as a Discovery class in [ocsf-schema#1724](https://github.com/ocsf/ocsf-schema/issues/1724) |
| Capability-set change & AgBOM (MUST / SHOULD) | Inventory Info; App Lifecycle (6002) | No agent-composition BOM, no dependency graph, no capability-change event | `supply_chain.ai_bom.*` | New **`ai_bom`** object (BOM ref, format, signature, dependency edges) + a **capability-change** activity on Agent Activity (9001). [ocsf-schema#1724](https://github.com/ocsf/ocsf-schema/issues/1724) already proposes the declared-versus-executed configuration record, emitted at first use of a new dependency and chained with `record_integrity`; cite it as the vehicle for capability-change timing |
| Observability-plane integrity (SHOULD) | `record_integrity` profile + `attestation` object on `base_event` (OCSF 1.9.0, [ocsf-schema#1661](https://github.com/ocsf/ocsf-schema/pull/1661)): per-event `fingerprint`, `signatures`, `chain_uid`, `prev_event` linkage | No enforcement-availability, fail-open, or hook-coverage representation. Event continuity (§15) maps to `attestation.prev_event` and `attestation.chain_uid` with no new schema | `security.guardrail.*` (partial) | Add **enforcement availability / failure-mode** attrs to `ai_guardrail`; add **instrumentation coverage** to `ai_asset` |
| Policy enforcement & mediation (MUST / SHOULD) | Authorization (3003) partially; Detection Finding (2004) for classifier verdicts | No authorization-decision object for AI operations; no information-flow/taint labels; no human-approval lifecycle; no attribute-provenance marking; no mediation-coverage representation | `security.*` (partial) | New **`ai_authorization`** object (decision, reason, code, deciding authority, rule id, obligations); new **`ai_taint`** object (labels, scope, origin, taint-caused denial); new **`ai_approval`** object (correlation id, status, IdP-verified approver, channel, scope-binding result); an **`attribute_source`** enum (idp / pdp / enforcement-state / platform / **self-asserted**) usable on identity, authorization, and agent-state attributes |

### E.2 What CoSAI asks OCSF to include (summary)

1. **Promote the two proposed AI event classes to ratified:** **AI Agent Activity (9001)** and **AI Delegation Activity (9002)**.
2. **Extend the existing `ai_operation` profile** (which already carries `ai_agent`, `ai_model`, `delegation`, `message_context`, and, once ocsf-schema#1704 merges, `ai_stop_reason_id`) so that it represents the [classification summary](#45-classification-summary) using **class- and activity-specific applicability**: common correlation attributes are required at profile level, while the remaining MUST fields are required when their defining operation or event applies. SHOULD/MAY fields remain recommended/optional within the same applicable scope.
3. **Add or extend AI-specific objects:** extend `message_context` (content hashes, redaction flags, system prompt) and `delegation` (scope, constraints, lifecycle state); land `ai_tool`/`mcp` (ocsf-schema#1729); add `ai_guardrail`, `ai_memory`, `ai_retrieval`, `runtime_attestation`, `ai_asset`, `ai_bom`, `ai_authorization`, `ai_taint`, `ai_approval`.
4. **Add AI-specific enums:** `trust_level`, `autonomy_level` (L1 to L5), `tool_trust_boundary`, `memory_provenance`, `enforcement_decision` (allow / deny, the terminal verdict, with an `is_modified` flag for allow-after-modification and a machine-readable code on deny; a fail-closed enforcement failure is a deny coded as such), `enforcement_step_action` (allowed / denied / modified_payload / modified_extensions / deny_suppressed / aborted / error, one per plugin or rule that ran, so that a suppressed deny is queryable), `enforcement_failure_mode` (fail-open / fail-closed), `mcp_primitive` (tool / resource / prompt / sampling / elicitation / roots), `trigger_type` (user-initiated / autonomous), **`attribute_source`** (idp / pdp / enforcement-state / platform / self-asserted), **`taint_scope`** (session / message), **`approval_status`** (pending / resolved / expired / bypassed).
5. **ATLAS technique tagging needs no OCSF change.** Detection Finding's `attacks[]` is already documented as compatible with MITRE ATLAS tactics, techniques and sub-techniques, and `attack.version` carries the matrix version. The [ATLAS Technique Tag](#a5-attack-inventory--mitre-atlas-technique-mapping) is portable today; this document supplies the producer guidance (populate `attacks[].technique.uid` with `AML.Txxxx`) rather than an ask.
6. **Agent attribution rides `ai_agent`, not an actor type.** OWASP AOS's OCSF binding currently represents the agent through the `actor.user` type enum with an "Other" override and a free-text `"AI Agent"`: a documented workaround, and one that types the agent as a kind of user. The OCSF `actor` object has no type of its own. The correct representation exists: `ai_agent` on the `ai_operation` profile for which agent acted, and `delegation` for whose authority it acted under. The change is on the AOS side (see [F.5](#f5-what-this-document-contributes-back-to-aos)): migrate the binding to `ai_agent` + `delegation`.

### E.3 Incremental extension path via AITF

AITF lets adopters emit this telemetry **before** OCSF ratifies it, and stages the upstream proposals so each is backward-compatible:

- **Phase 0, today.** AITF carries every MUST field as OTel attributes and emits OCSF via the `ai_operation` profile on existing classes (6003/6005/2004/3002); the ATLAS tag rides on `compliance.control_id` (framework `mitre_atlas`).
- **Phase 1, profile extension (backward-compatible).** Contribute the MUST attribute set + `ai_content`, `ai_guardrail`, and `ai_tool` objects to the OCSF `ai_operation` profile; no new classes required.
- **Phase 2, agentic classes.** Ratify **AI Agent Activity (9001)** plus the `ai_memory` and `ai_retrieval` objects (memory & RAG are absent from OCSF today and are MUST here).
- **Phase 3, delegated authority.** Ratify **AI Delegation Activity (9002)** and the `ai_attestation` object (ODIS-aligned), and land the ATLAS technique reference on findings.
- **Phase 4, inventory & analytics.** SHOULD/MAY clusters (`ai_asset`, drift, quality, fleet aggregates) as they stabilize.

**Governance rule for promotion:** a field graduates from AITF-proposed to an OCSF standardization ask when **≥ 2 independent attacks in [Appendix A](#appendix-a-attack--incident-inventory)** require it, the same attack-grounding rule that sets the MUST tier. This keeps the OCSF surface minimal and evidence-driven rather than speculative.

## Appendix F: OWASP AOS Cross Reference

The [OWASP Agent Observability Standard](https://aos.owasp.org/) (AOS) defines how agents expose runtime behaviour through hooks, events, and a queryable Agent Bill-of-Materials; this RFC defines which security fields are required and how they are tiered. The tables below map AOS's **Instrument**, **Trace**, and **Inspect** pillars to the field set. Status values:

| Status | Meaning |
| :----------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Covered** | In the field set. |
| **Partial** | Deliberately narrower coverage; the difference is explained. |
| **Out of scope** | Control-plane or wire-protocol material this document intentionally does not specify. |

> **Draft caveat.** Every AOS page consulted is marked *working draft*, and several were read through summarizing retrieval rather than verbatim. Re-verify element names against the live specification before treating this cross reference as normative. Where AOS field names appear below they are given as encountered, in `code style`.

### F.1 Pillar 1: Instrument

*AOS's Instrument pillar defines lifecycle hooks that emit to, and can be intervened on by, a **Guardian Agent**: a policy decision point that returns `allow`, `deny`, or `modify` before the agent proceeds. This is the pillar that required the most additions, because a guardrail model that only records verdicts is observational (a verdict was recorded) rather than interventional (a decision was enforced, or failed to be).*

| AOS element | This document | Status |
| :-------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------- | :------ |
| Hook set (agent trigger, user message, agent response, tool call request, tool call result, memory store, memory retrieval, knowledge retrieval, MCP inbound/outbound) | Field coverage across §§5 to 12; **Instrumentation Coverage / Hook Attestation** (§15) records which hooks are live | **Covered** |
| Decision `allow` / `deny` | Guardrail (Input/Output) Verdict, pass / block (§§6 to 7) | Covered |
| Decision `modify` + `modifiedRequest` | **Guardrail Modification Record** (§6), cross-cutting | **Covered** |
| `reasoning` (human-readable decision rationale) | Guardrail Verdict detector + score (§§6 to 7) | Covered |
| `reasonCode[]` (machine-readable) | **Policy Reason Code** (§15) | **Covered** |
| Enforcement callout failure, timeout, unavailability | **Enforcement-Point Availability & Failure Mode** (§15) | **Covered** |
| `ping` / liveness | **Enforcement-Point Availability** + **Event Sequence Continuity** (§15) | **Covered** |
| `StepContext`: agent, session, turn, step, timestamp, user, organization | **Session / Turn / Step IDs**, **Organization / Tenant ID** (§5) | **Covered** |
| `Agent` object, name, id, description, version, `instructions`, provider, model, tools, mcpServers, resources | Agent Name, Instance ID, System Prompt (§5); Model fields (§8); inventory (§14) | Covered |
| `Message` object + `Part` union (TextPart / FilePart / DataPart) | **Content Modality & Attachment Identity** (§6), cross-cutting | **Covered** |
| `ToolDefinition` / `ToolArgumentDefinition` / `ToolOutputDefinition` | **Tool Definition Digest** (§9) | **Covered** |
| `ToolCallRequest`: `executionId`, `toolId`, inputs | **Tool Execution ID** (§9) + Tool Call I/O, Tool Name (§9) | **Covered** |
| `Source` union, FileSource, SiteSource | **Citations / Source Attribution** (§7) | **Covered** |
| `KnowledgeRetrievalStepParams`: query, keywords, results | Retrieval Event, Retrieved-Content Source (§11) | Covered |
| `A2AContext`: from / to, role (client / server) | **Peer Agent Card / Descriptor** (§12); Identities Used (§13) | **Covered** |
| Guardian Agent architecture; agent↔guardian authentication | Not specified, but its **outcomes** are, via §15 | Out of scope |
| JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP(S); error code ranges | Wire protocol not specified; error *content* covered by LLM Error (§8), Tool Error (§9) | Out of scope |

### F.2 Pillar 2: Trace

*AOS's Trace pillar defines the event set and its bindings to OpenTelemetry and OCSF. This is the field set's strongest area; the gaps were per-step reasoning, citations, the identifier hierarchy, and protocol-level events.*

| AOS element | This document | Status |
| :------------------------------------- | :---------------------------------------- | :----------------------- |
| `steps/agentTrigger`: `trigger.type` (autonomous), `trigger.event`, content | **Trigger Type & Source Event** (§5) | **Covered** |
| `steps/message`: role, content | Model Input (§6); Response (§7); System Prompt (§5) | Covered |
| `steps/message`: `citations` | **Citations / Source Attribution** (§7) | **Covered** |
| `steps/message`: `reasoning` | Observation / Thought (§7) | Covered |
| `steps/toolCallRequest`: `reasoning` | **Tool Selection Rationale** (§9) | **Covered** |
| `steps/toolCallResult`: `executionId`, outputs, `isError` | Tool Call I/O, Tool Error (§9); **Tool Execution ID** (§9) | **Covered** |
| `steps/memoryStore`: memory, `reasoning` | Memory Write (§10); **Memory Write Rationale** (§10) | **Covered** |
| `steps/memoryContextRetrieval`: memory, `reasoning` | Memory Read (§10) | Covered |
| `steps/knowledgeRetrieval`: query, keywords, results | Retrieval Event (§11) | Covered |
| `protocols/MCP`: full JSON-RPC payload | **MCP Server Identity & Primitive** (§9); **Protocol Envelope Capture** (§12) | **Covered** |
| `protocols/A2A`: full JSON-RPC payload | **A2A Task Lifecycle Event**, **Protocol Envelope Capture** (§12) | **Covered** |
| A2A methods: `message/send`, `message/stream`, `tasks/get`, `tasks/cancel`, `tasks/resubscribe`, `tasks/pushNotificationConfig/get`+`/set` | **A2A Task Lifecycle Event** (§12) | **Covered** |
| `ping`: timestamp, timeout, status, version | §15 (see [F.1](#f1-pillar-1-instrument)) | **Covered** |
| OTel span hierarchy: `agent.run`, `agent.plan`, turn spans, step spans | **Session / Turn / Step IDs** + **Trace Context** (§5) specify the *identifiers and propagation*; span naming is left to the OTel binding | **Partial**: deliberate; this document is field-level, and span naming belongs in AITF |
| OTel attribute naming: `agent.*`, `llm.model.name`, `llm.provider.name` | This document uses OTel GenAI semconv `gen_ai.*` throughout ([Appendix C](#appendix-c-aitf--odis-cross-reference)) | **Divergence**: see [F.6](#f6-divergences--open-coordination-items) |
| OCSF binding: API Activity 6003, `type_uid` 600301, `actor.type_id: 99` "AI Agent", `unmapped.aos` namespace | [Appendix E](#appendix-e-implications-for-ocsf--aitf-the-standardization-bridge) proposes ratified classes 9001/9002 and an `ai_operation` profile | **Divergence**: see [F.6](#f6-divergences--open-coordination-items) |
| Sensitive-attribute handling ("may necessitate hashing, truncation, or redaction") | [Privacy-preserving logging](#18-implementation-guidance), access control, tiered retention, redaction pipelines, hash-first correlation | Covered (stronger) |

### F.3 Pillar 3: Inspect

*AOS's Inspect pillar requires an agent to answer inspection requests with a dynamically-maintained **AgBOM**, bound to CycloneDX, SPDX, or SWID. This was the largest structural gap: §14 existed, but as a flat set of mostly-MAY attributes attached to events rather than as an inventory artifact, and with no signal at all for composition **change**.*

| AOS element | This document | Status |
| :------------------------------------------------ | :--------------------------------------------- | :------- |
| AgBOM as a queryable, on-demand artifact | **AgBOM / Inventory Snapshot** (§14) | **Covered** |
| Dynamic refresh on discovery / removal / modification of agents, MCP servers, knowledge bases, tools, memory, models | **Capability-Set Change Event** (§14), MUST | **Covered** |
| Entity: Standard Packages, name, description, version | Tool/Agent Version, Repository/Software Ref (§14) | Covered |
| Entity: Models, identity, version, description, endpoint, `modelContextWindow`, arguments | Model Name/Version, Provider/Endpoint Identity (§8); **Inference Parameters** (§8) | **Covered** |
| Entity: Capabilities, agent cards, discovered agents, MCP servers and their protocols | **Peer Agent Card / Descriptor** (§12); **MCP Server Identity & Primitive** (§9) | **Covered** |
| Entity: Knowledge, name, description, schema, search parameters | **Declared Knowledge-Source Configuration** (§11) | **Covered** |
| Entity: Memory, name, description, type, size constraints, retrieval spec | **Declared Memory Configuration** (§10) | **Covered** |
| Entity: Tools, name, description, scheme, local and MCP endpoints | **Tool Definition Digest** (§9); **MCP Server Identity** (§9) | **Covered** |
| CycloneDX `dependencies[].dependsOn` | **Component Dependency Graph** (§14) | **Covered** |
| CycloneDX `signatures[]`: `value`, `keyId` | **Inventory Attestation Signature** (§14) | **Covered** |
| CycloneDX properties: `sandbox`, `languageRuntime`, `environment.os`, `environment.architecture`, `timeoutMs` | **Execution Environment / Sandbox** (§9) | **Covered** |
| CycloneDX properties: `auth`, `scope`, `endpoint` | Tool ACL / Required Scope (§9); Output Egress Destination (§7) | Covered |
| CycloneDX properties: `memoryBackend`, `memoryLimitMB` | **Declared Memory Configuration** (§10) | **Covered** |
| CycloneDX property: `compliance` | Not a distinct field; AITF `compliance.*` carries it ([Appendix C](#appendix-c-aitf--odis-cross-reference)) | Partial |
| SPDX and SWID bindings | **AgBOM / Inventory Snapshot** (§14) is format-agnostic and names all three | Covered |
| CycloneDX property: `a2aCardUrl` | **Peer Agent Card / Descriptor** (§12) | **Covered** |

### F.4 What this implies for OpenTelemetry, AITF and OCSF

Closing the AOS gaps surfaced attributes missing from this document's bindings. All were initially filed against AITF; [Appendix D](#appendix-d-implications-for-opentelemetry-the-instrumentation-bridge) then established that **several already have an upstream home in the OpenTelemetry GenAI conventions**, and that others are answered by OTel's *native structure* rather than by any new attribute. That changes where each ask should be filed.

**The coordination finding: where OTel already defines a name, AITF should adopt it rather than mint a parallel one.** Three of the twelve asks below were substantially resolved upstream while this document was being written, the GenAI conventions gained `gen_ai.tool.definitions`, `gen_ai.tool.call.id`, and an entire `mcp.*` namespace. Filing them again against AITF would create exactly the drift [F.6](#f6-divergences--open-coordination-items) warns about between AOS's `llm.*` binding and semconv's `gen_ai.*`.

| # | Ask | OpenTelemetry today | Where to file |
| :---- | :------------------------ | :---------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------ |
| 1 | **Turn and step identifiers**, plus guidance that the run maps to the trace ID rather than to a session attribute | `gen_ai.conversation.id`, `gen_ai.workflow.name`; **step ordering is already native**: the `invoke_agent` → `execute_tool` → `chat` span tree *is* the step hierarchy, and the span ID *is* the step ID. The **turn** level has no representation | **OTel** (`gen_ai.turn.id`); AITF adopts. Do **not** mint a step-ID attribute, use the span |
| 2 | **Enforcement outcome attributes**: reachability, latency, fail-open/fail-closed, a `modify` decision value, before/after digests | `gen_ai.evaluation.*` exists but is quality-oriented, no blocked/allowed outcome, guardrail type, or threat reference | **OTel** by extending `gen_ai.evaluation.*` ([D.3](#d3-what-cosai-asks-opentelemetry-to-include) item 2); enforcement *availability* to OCSF |
| 3 | **Content-part attributes**: part type, MIME type, attachment name/size/hash | `gen_ai.input.messages` / `gen_ai.output.messages` carry typed parts; **no attachment identity or hash** | **OTel**: extend existing message parts |
| 4 | **Citation attributes** on output, with a resolution flag against retrieval | `gen_ai.retrieval.documents` covers the retrieval side; nothing on the output side | **OTel** |
| 5 | **Tool contract attributes**: definition digest; consistent request↔result correlator | **`gen_ai.tool.definitions` and `gen_ai.tool.call.id` both exist upstream** | **Resolved upstream.** AITF adopts the names; only `…definitions.hash` remains to file with OTel |
| 6 | **Execution-environment attributes**: sandbox mode, runtime, OS/architecture, timeout, egress policy | Runtime and platform are already covered by **core resource conventions** (`host.*`, `os.*`, `process.runtime.*`). **Sandbox mode and egress policy are not** | **Reuse** core resource semconv; file only `sandbox` and egress policy as new |
| 7 | **MCP primitive discriminator**, server version and transport | **A full `mcp.*` namespace exists**: `mcp.method.name`, `mcp.protocol.version`, `mcp.request.id`, `mcp.resource.uri`, `mcp.session.id`, plus client/server duration metrics | **Largely resolved upstream.** `mcp.method.name` partially serves as the discriminator; file only an explicit primitive value set |
| 8 | **A2A attributes**: task lifecycle, push-notification callback registration, peer agent card | **Nothing.** The GenAI repository covers MCP but has no A2A conventions | **OTel**: an `a2a.*` namespace, parallel to `mcp.*`, is the natural proposal |
| 9 | **Trigger attributes**: user-initiated vs autonomous, and source event | Nothing | **OTel** ([D.3](#d3-what-cosai-asks-opentelemetry-to-include) item 6) |
| 10 | **Tenant / organization** | No tenant attribute, but **resource attributes are the established mechanism** for this class of value | **Reuse** resource semconv; propose a tenant attribute only if none fits |
| 11 | **Declared-configuration attributes** for memory and knowledge sources | **`gen_ai.memory.*` exists** (store/record identity, query, count, and a memory span), but carries no declared-configuration, provenance or footprint attributes; knowledge partially via `gen_ai.data_source.id` | **OTel**: extend `gen_ai.memory.*` ([D.3](#d3-what-cosai-asks-opentelemetry-to-include) item 3, pending re-scope) |
| 12 | **Instrumentation coverage** and **event sequence number** | **Instrumentation scope is native**: every signal carries an emitting scope name and version, which partially answers coverage. **No envelope sequence number**, and no gap-detection concept | Coverage: **reuse** instrumentation scope, extend for hook-level detail. Sequence number: **OCSF**, as an envelope concern rather than an instrumentation one |

**What the pattern shows.** Of twelve asks, two are substantially resolved upstream (5, 7), three are answered wholly or partly by OTel structure that already exists and should be reused rather than duplicated (1, 6, 10, and the first half of 12), and seven remain genuine gaps. Memory is not among them. OpenTelemetry now carries a `gen_ai.memory.*` namespace and a memory span ([D.1](#d1-what-the-genai-conventions-cover-today)), and AITF carries `memory.*` including `memory.provenance` ([Appendix C](#appendix-c-aitf--odis-cross-reference)). What remains absent upstream is narrower and specific: **memory provenance and footprint**, the two attributes `IR-02`, `IR-05` and `AOC-05` turn on.

**Governance.** Per the rule in [E.3](#e3-incremental-extension-path-via-aitf), each item graduates from AITF-proposed to a standardization ask once ≥ 2 independent attacks in [Appendix A](#appendix-a-attack--incident-inventory) require it, a bar every MUST-tier item above already clears. File emission-side asks with OpenTelemetry, consumption-side asks with OCSF, and use AITF to carry both in the interim.

### F.5 What this document contributes back to AOS

The cross reference runs both ways. AOS defines a strong exposure interface but does not answer the questions this document is organized around, and the following are offered as contributions upstream:

1. **Attack grounding.** AOS asserts that agents should be observable; it does not tie any element to a documented attack. [Appendix A](#appendix-a-attack--incident-inventory) supplies a 34-item corpus with per-field evidence.
2. **Priority tiering.** AOS has no MUST/SHOULD/MAY distinction across its event and AgBOM fields, so an implementer has no guidance on what to instrument first. The [classification summary](#45-classification-summary) and [maturity model](#18-implementation-guidance) supply one, with an explicit evidence rule behind it.
3. **MITRE ATLAS technique tagging.** AOS has no threat-classification vocabulary. The [ATLAS Technique Tag](#a5-attack-inventory--mitre-atlas-technique-mapping) makes AOS-derived detections correlate with the ATT&CK-aligned rest of a SOC.
4. **Input trust classification.** AOS captures message `role` (user / agent / system) but not the *trusted-instruction vs untrusted-data* distinction that the CoSAI risk map treats as the core agentic control (§6). This is arguably the single highest-value field AOS lacks.
5. **Output egress destination.** AOS traces messages and tool calls but has no field for *where output went*: recipients, outbound URLs, broadcast scope. §7 argues this is the field that catches `TA-01` and `TA-03` before data leaves.
6. **Delegation and attestation.** AOS's `A2AContext` records the immediate from/to hop but not the originating principal, the multi-hop delegation chain, granted authorizations, or runtime attestation. §13 and the ODIS cross reference in [Appendix C](#appendix-c-aitf--odis-cross-reference) supply these.
7. **Verified vs displayed identity.** `AOC-08`'s lesson (bind and log the immutable identifier, not the display name) applies directly to AOS's user objects and A2A agent cards, which are displayed identities by construction.
8. **Observability-plane integrity (§15).** AOS's own architecture creates the exposure: a synchronous guardian callout is a dependency that can fail or be starved, and a self-reporting agent can omit. AOS specifies the happy path; §15 specifies the telemetry for when it does not hold. This is the contribution most specific to AOS's design.
9. **Privacy and retention normativity.** AOS notes that sensitive attributes "may necessitate hashing, truncation, or redaction." [Privacy-preserving logging](#18-implementation-guidance) gives a concrete position: access control, tiered retention, hash-first correlation, and redaction as an audited, logged transformation.

### F.6 Divergences & open coordination items

Two genuine divergences and two coordination items. None is blocking; all should be reconciled before either document is treated as normative alongside the other.

1. **OCSF strategy.** AOS extends **API Activity (6003)** with an `unmapped.aos` namespace and types the agent as `actor.type_id: 99` ("Other") with `type: "AI Agent"`. [Appendix E](#appendix-e-implications-for-ocsf--aitf-the-standardization-bridge) instead asks OCSF to ratify **AI Agent Activity (9001)** and **AI Delegation Activity (9002)** plus an `ai_operation` profile. These are different bets on the same schema. The positions are reconcilable and arguably sequential. AOS's `unmapped.*` approach is the correct *interim* carrier under an unratified schema, and matches Phase 0 in [E.3](#e3-incremental-extension-path-via-aitf); this document's asks are the ratification endpoint. Worth noting that AOS's need for an `actor.type_id: 99` workaround is independent evidence for standardization ask (6) in [E.2](#e2-what-cosai-asks-ocsf-to-include-summary). **Action:** align on a shared phase plan before either party submits to OCSF.
2. **OpenTelemetry attribute naming.** AOS's OTel binding uses `agent.*`, `llm.model.name`, and `llm.provider.name`. This document and AITF use the OTel **GenAI semantic conventions** (`gen_ai.*`), which is the upstream-maintained namespace; `llm.*` is not current semconv. The divergence is wider than a prefix: AOS's binding predates the GenAI conventions moving to their own repository and gaining `gen_ai.system_instructions`, `gen_ai.tool.definitions`, the retrieval attributes, and a full `mcp.*` namespace; much of what AOS models by hand now has an upstream home (see [Appendix D.1](#d1-what-the-genai-conventions-cover-today)). **Action:** recommend AOS migrate its OTel binding to `gen_ai.*` / `mcp.*`. Low cost while both are drafts, high cost later.
3. **Scope boundary.** This document treats enforcement *outcomes* as telemetry (§15) and the enforcement *protocol* as out of scope. AOS specifies the protocol and is comparatively quiet on outcomes. The split is clean and probably correct, but it is a choice both groups should ratify rather than assume, see [open question 10](#open-questions-for-the-working-group).
4. **Draft status and re-verification.** All AOS pillars are working drafts, with the CycloneDX AgBOM binding explicitly "under development." This cross reference is a point-in-time snapshot and should be re-run before publication.

## Appendix G: CPEX Cross Reference

[CPEX](https://contextforge-org.github.io/cpex/) is a deterministic reference monitor between an agent and its capabilities. It produces the policy, identity, taint, approval, and routing decisions recorded by §16; this appendix maps those outputs to the field set and identifies remaining gaps.

> **Draft caveat.** CPEX documentation was read at the URLs cited and includes a legacy 0.1.x track alongside current material. Field and function names below are given as encountered; re-verify against the live specification before treating this cross reference as normative.

### G.1 The threat model: the most important contribution

CPEX's [threat model](https://contextforge-org.github.io/cpex/docs/threat-model/) is a zero-trust, assume-breach model whose central move is to treat **the LLM itself as the adversary**, not merely as a component an adversary attacks. Three assumptions:

1. **Input vulnerability**: "Prompt injection can arrive through any content the model reads: user messages, tool results, fetched resources, other agents' replies."
2. **Output manipulation**: "An injected instruction becomes a tool call, an argument value, an email body. **The model is a confused deputy.**"
3. **No security properties**: the model cannot maintain confidentiality or enforce authorization; context contents can leak through permitted channels.

From this follows the trust boundary: everything on the agent side of the monitor is assumed hostile, and **"nothing the policy reads comes from there: verified tokens come from the IdP, decisions from the PDP, taint labels from the session store."**

**Read strictly, the rest of this document operates on a weaker premise, and the gap is not cosmetic.** §§5 to 15 treat the agent as a *victim* of attack, something to be instrumented so that attacks against it become visible. Under CPEX's model the agent is also a potential *liar*, and that distinction propagates straight into the telemetry: several fields this document marks MUST or SHOULD are values the agent itself supplies. **Autonomy Level** (§5), **Task / Intent Declaration** (§12), **System Prompt** (§5), **Observation / Thought** (§7), and every reasoning field are self-asserted. A compromised agent can report a benign autonomy level while acting outside it, and `AOC-01` is the corpus's demonstration that agents do misreport: it declared a secret destroyed while the data remained recoverable.

**Verified vs Displayed Identity** (§13) is already MUST because `AOC-08` turns on the difference between an immutable identifier and a spoofable display name. CPEX generalizes that lesson: identity is not special; *every* security-relevant attribute has a provenance, and telemetry that does not record it cannot survive the assume-breach model. That is the reasoning behind the new cross-cutting **Attribute Source / Trusted-Provenance Marking** ([§16](#16-policy-enforcement--mediation)), and it is the largest change this appendix produced.

Denied and failed attempts are first-class telemetry under this model, not exhaust. CPEX's audit requirement explicitly includes denied attempts. This document was already aligned in spirit (`AOC-12`/`AOC-13`/`AOC-14` are catalogued because their telemetry documents *attempted* attacks that were resisted) but §16's Authorization Decision Record now makes it structural rather than incidental.

### G.2 Threats & controls cross reference

CPEX's threat matrix, mapped to this document's fields. This is the tightest available test of coverage, because each row is a control CPEX considers necessary.

| CPEX threat | CPEX control | Covered by | Status |
| :------------- | :------------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :--------------------------- |
| Prompt-injection tool misuse | Policy gates and argument validation before dispatch | Input Trust Classification, Guardrail (Input) Verdict (§6); Tool Call I/O (§9); **Authorization Decision Record** (§16) | **Covered**: the decision record was missing |
| Confused deputy / privilege escalation | Per-caller identity from verified tokens | Identities Used, Verified vs Displayed Identity, Granted Authorizations (§13) | Covered |
| Cross-request data exfiltration | Session-level taint blocks the write-down | **Session Taint Labels & Information-Flow Decisions** (§16) | **Covered**: expressible as state, not only as a correlation pattern |
| Credential exposure | Fresh audience-scoped tokens minted per call | **Credential Minting & Scope-Narrowing Check** (§13) | **Covered** |
| PII disclosure | Field-level redaction on outputs | Guardrail (Output) Verdict (§7); Guardrail Modification Record (§6); Tool Privacy Classification (§9) | Partial: see [G.5](#g5-divergences--gaps-remaining) on field-level granularity |
| Unauthorized high-impact actions | Out-of-band human approval | **Human Approval / Elicitation Event** (§16) | **Covered** |
| Approval replay | Approvals bound to live arguments | **Human Approval / Elicitation Event**: scope-binding validation result (§16) | **Covered** |
| Unaccountable actions | Append-only audit per decision, denied attempts included | **Authorization Decision Record** (§16); Event Sequence Continuity (§15) | **Covered** |

Five of eight CPEX controls map only to fields in §16; they had **no counterpart** anywhere else in the field set. That is the strongest single finding in this appendix, and it reflects a real blind spot rather than a difference of emphasis: the document was thorough on *observation* and near-silent on *enforcement*.

### G.3 APL, CMF & identity surface

| CPEX element | This document | Status |
| :----------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- | :------------------ |

| Extension mutability tiers: immutable / **monotonic** / mutable | Monotonicity is asserted for taint and delegation but not recorded | Out of scope: policy-engine internal |
| Capability-gating: plugins declare capabilities; extensions filtered per plugin | Least-privilege for enforcement components | Out of scope: enforcement architecture |
| Deployment placements: gateway / sidecar / in-process, each with named coverage gaps | **Mediation Coverage & Bypass Path** (§16) | **Covered** |
| Builtins: `identity/jwt`, `delegator/oauth`, `validator/pii-scan`, `audit/logger`, `cedar-direct`, `cel`, `valkey` | Named as implementations, not telemetry | Out of scope |

### G.4 What this document contributes back to CPEX

1. **Retention, priority, and evidence.** CPEX produces decision records; it does not say which are worth keeping, for how long, or in what order to adopt them. The [tiering rubric](#42-classification-legend) and [maturity model](#18-implementation-guidance) supply that, with attack grounding behind each call.
2. **A SOC destination.** CPEX's audit log is a local artifact. [Appendix E](#appendix-e-implications-for-ocsf--aitf-the-standardization-bridge) now proposes `ai_authorization`, `ai_taint`, and `ai_approval` OCSF objects plus an `attribute_source` enum, so enforcement decisions correlate with the rest of the security estate rather than sitting in a separate store.
3. **MITRE ATLAS tagging.** CPEX has no threat-classification vocabulary; a denial carries a policy reason, not a technique. Stamping decisions with `AML.Txxxx` ([A.5](#a5-attack-inventory--mitre-atlas-technique-mapping)) makes them correlate with ATT&CK-aligned tooling.
4. **The observation surface CPEX explicitly cannot see.** CPEX mediates the agent↔capability boundary. It does not observe memory reads and writes (§10), retrieval and its provenance (§11), token consumption and loop behaviour (§8, §12), model supply chain (§8), or asset composition (§14). `IR-02` (MINJA) poisons memory using entirely benign queries; every individual operation is policy-clean, and a reference monitor sees nothing wrong. **Enforcement and observation are complementary, not substitutable**, and a deployment running CPEX still needs most of §§5 to 14.
5. **Provider-side and governance signals.** `AOC-06`, silent provider truncation on sensitive topics, is invisible to a reference monitor, since the operation was permitted and completed.
6. **Attack grounding for the threat matrix.** CPEX's threat rows are stated as principles; [Appendix A](#appendix-a-attack--incident-inventory) supplies documented incidents for each, which is useful for justifying the controls to a risk committee.

### G.5 Divergences & gaps remaining

1. **Redaction granularity.** CPEX redacts *per field* under a predicate (`ssn: 'str | redact(!perm.view_ssn)'`); this document's **Guardrail Modification Record** is whole-payload. Per-field records are more useful and more privacy-sensitive at once. Left as-is deliberately (a per-field redaction map is a policy decision, not a default) but implementers running field-level pipelines should record at that granularity.
2. **Route-phase identity is not captured.** CPEX distinguishes four phases, and *which* phase denied an operation is diagnostically meaningful (argument validation vs authorization vs post-check). This document records the decision but not the phase. A candidate sub-attribute of the Authorization Decision Record; not proposed as a separate field.
3. **CMF normalization is an unadopted good idea.** CPEX's Common Message Format lets one policy cover tool calls, A2A, inference, prompts, and resources uniformly. This document still organizes telemetry by *component* (§§5 to 14), which means an equivalent operation is described differently depending on which pipeline carried it. The component organization is deliberate (it maps to the CoSAI Risk Map) but a normalized **operation view** across protocols would make cross-protocol detections expressible. Flagged as [open question 15](#open-questions-for-the-working-group).
4. **Covert channels are out of scope for both.** CPEX states plainly that "determined models can encode data within permitted output channels." This document's **Output Egress Destination** and **Citations** narrow the channel but do not close it. Neither document should claim otherwise.
5. **Host compromise.** CPEX's guarantees "hold only with intact processes and state stores"; this document's §15 covers telemetry suppression but neither addresses a compromised enforcement host. Shared limitation, worth stating in both.
6. **Terminology collision.** CPEX uses *taint* for session-scoped information-flow labels; this document uses *trust classification* for per-segment input labelling. They are different mechanisms and both are needed, §6 classifies a payload, §16 tracks accumulated state. The terms should not be merged, and §16 says so explicitly.

## Appendix H: Implications for NIST AI RMF and NIST CSF (incl. the Cyber AI Profile)

Appendices C to E route this field set toward **schemas**; F to G reference it against **adjacent technical standards**. This appendix and [Appendix I](#appendix-i-implications-for-isoiec-42001) address a different consumer: **governance frameworks that use telemetry as control evidence**.

That places them at the **A** end of this document's [use-case priority](#41-use-case-priorities): compliance audit, the lowest of the four. The ordering is deliberate: **this field set is designed for detection and response, and its audit value is a by-product.** A telemetry programme built to satisfy an auditor produces different fields than one built to catch `TA-01`, and where the two diverge this document follows detection. The useful consequence is that a deployment implementing the MUST tier for **D** and **R** reasons will find it has already produced most of the evidence these frameworks ask for, which is a far easier argument to fund than the reverse.

> **Status caveat.** NIST AI RMF 1.0 (January 2023) is **under revision**. The **Cyber AI Profile** is at *preliminary draft* (**NIST IR 8596**, published 16 December 2025); its comment period has closed and an Initial Public Draft was expected in mid-2026. Structure and identifiers below were read at the time of writing and must be re-verified before publication.

### H.1 Why these two frameworks, and how they differ

| Framework | What it governs | Relationship to this document |
| :-------------------- | :------------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------------- |
| **NIST AI RMF 1.0** (+ **AI 600-1** Generative AI Profile) | AI-specific risk management across **GOVERN / MAP / MEASURE / MANAGE** | Asks *whether AI risks are identified, measured and managed.* This field set is the **measurement substrate**: mostly MEASURE, with MANAGE for response |
| **NIST CSF 2.0** (+ the **Cyber AI Profile**, NIST IR 8596) | Cybersecurity outcomes across **GV / ID / PR / DE / RS / RC** | Asks *whether attacks are detected and responded to.* This is the closer fit by far, the document's D and R priorities map almost one-to-one onto **DE** and **RS** |

The **Cyber AI Profile** is the significant development for this work. It is a CSF 2.0 *community profile* that overlays three **AI Focus Areas** on existing CSF outcomes:

- **Secure**: securing AI systems and their infrastructure.
- **Detect**: using AI to strengthen cyber defence.
- **Thwart**: defending against adversarial *uses* of AI.

**This document sits squarely in *Secure*, and it is the telemetry layer that focus area presupposes.** The Profile asks organizations to achieve CSF detection and response outcomes *for AI systems*; it does not specify which fields make that possible. That is precisely the gap this document fills, and the alignment is close enough that the CoSAI field set is a credible candidate reference for Profile implementers.

### H.2 CSF 2.0 mapping, by function

CSF Categories cited: **GV.OC** Organizational Context · **GV.SC** Cybersecurity Supply Chain Risk Management · **ID.AM** Asset Management · **ID.RA** Risk Assessment · **PR.AA** Identity Management, Authentication and Access Control · **PR.DS** Data Security · **DE.CM** Continuous Monitoring · **DE.AE** Adverse Event Analysis · **RS.MA** Incident Management · **RS.AN** Incident Analysis · **RC.RP** Incident Recovery Plan Execution.

| CSF function | Telemetry that evidences it | Coverage |
| :------ | :----------------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------- |
| **GOVERN** (GV.OC, GV.SC) | Asset inventory and AgBOM (§14); model provenance and signing (§8); dependency graph and version (§14); autonomy level and task declaration (§§5, 8) | **Partial**: supply-chain outcomes are well served; policy and role outcomes are organizational, not telemetric |
| **IDENTIFY** (ID.AM, ID.RA) | Agent name, instance ID, surface (§5); capability-set change (§14); AgBOM (§14); tool and MCP inventory (§9); fleet aggregates (§14) | **Strong**: Capability-Set Change is the field that makes ID.AM *continuous* rather than periodic |
| **PROTECT** (PR.AA, PR.DS) | Identities used, verified-vs-displayed identity, granted authorizations, credential minting (§13); authorization decision record (§16); guardrail verdicts (§§6 to 7); sandbox posture (§9) | **Strong**: §§13 and 16 are PR.AA evidence almost verbatim |
| **DETECT** (DE.CM, DE.AE) | **The entire MUST tier.** Input trust classification and guardrail verdicts (§6); output egress and refusals (§7); tool call I/O (§9); memory and retrieval events (§§10 to 11); loop and resource signals (§12); session taint (§16); every [correlation pattern](#17-correlation-patterns) | **Strongest alignment in the document.** DE.CM is continuous monitoring; DE.AE is the correlation-pattern layer |
| **RESPOND** (RS.MA, RS.AN) | The identifier hierarchy and trace context (§5); tool execution IDs (§9); memory and retrieval provenance (§§10 to 11); delegation chain (§13); ATLAS technique tag (§6); event sequence continuity (§15) | **Strong**: this is the document's **R** priority, and the ATLAS tag makes RS.AN findings portable |
| **RECOVER** (RC.RP) | Lifecycle state and revocation (§13); instance ID for per-instance quarantine (§5); capability-set change for rollback verification (§14) | **Weak, and appropriately so**: recovery is largely an operational discipline; telemetry scopes it but does not perform it |

Coverage is strongest where this document concentrates (**DETECT**, **RESPOND**) and weakest where its priorities place least weight (**RECOVER**, the organizational half of **GOVERN**). That follows the [D > R > Q > A ordering](#41-use-case-priorities), and it shows which CSF outcomes this field set will and will not evidence.

### H.3 AI RMF mapping, by function

| AI RMF function | Telemetry that evidences it | Coverage |
| :---- | :-------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------- |
| **GOVERN** | Autonomy level (§5); task/intent declaration (§12); tool ACL and scope (§9); human approval events (§16); privacy and retention posture ([Implementation Guidance](#18-implementation-guidance)) | Partial: **Human Approval / Elicitation** (§16) is the strongest single piece of GOVERN evidence, because it records oversight *actually exercised* rather than merely documented |
| **MAP** | Component taxonomy (§§5 to 16 organized by [CoSAI Risk Map](#appendix-b-mapping-to-the-cosai-risk-map-risks--controls)); AgBOM (§14); trust boundaries (§9); [Appendix A](#appendix-a-attack--incident-inventory) attack corpus | Strong: the risk-map component mapping and attack inventory are MAP artifacts in substance |
| **MEASURE** | **The whole field set.** Every MUST field; guardrail scores; refusal rates; loop and resource metrics; ATLAS-tagged detections | **The natural home.** AI RMF asks that AI risks be measured; this document specifies what to measure and why |
| **MANAGE** | Incident response fields (§§5, 9, 13); enforcement decisions and taint (§16); kill-switch and lifecycle state (§13); [correlation patterns](#17-correlation-patterns) | Strong for security risk; silent on fairness, bias, and environmental risk, which are out of scope here |

**Scope note.** AI RMF's trustworthiness characteristics extend well beyond security: validity, fairness, bias management, interpretability, and environmental impact. **This document evidences the security slice only.** An organization using AI RMF should not read comprehensive MEASURE coverage into it. The `gen_ai.evaluation.*` conventions discussed in [D.1](#d1-what-the-genai-conventions-cover-today) are the natural carrier for the quality and fairness slice, which is one more reason to keep security guardrail signals distinguishable from quality evaluations rather than merging them.

### H.4 What this implies

1. **Propose the field set as a reference implementation for the Cyber AI Profile's *Secure* focus area.** The Profile specifies outcomes for securing AI systems but not the telemetry that evidences them; this document supplies exactly that and is attack-grounded, which is the kind of justification a NIST community profile can cite. **This is the highest-value action in this appendix**, and the timing is favourable while the Profile is between preliminary and public draft.
2. **Publish a CSF subcategory-level mapping.** [H.2](#h2-csf-20-mapping-by-function) maps to Category granularity; auditors work at Subcategory granularity (106 subcategories). A per-subcategory mapping is mechanical work with real adoption value, and it is the single most requested artifact when a security framework meets a compliance programme.
3. **Do not reshape the field set to improve framework coverage.** The weak areas (RECOVER, organizational GOVERN) are weak because they are not telemetry problems. Adding fields to improve a coverage table would violate the [evidence rule](#42-classification-legend) and inflate the MUST tier for **A**-tier benefit.
4. **Track the AI RMF revision.** AI RMF 1.0 is under revision and the Generative AI Profile (AI 600-1) already extends it; if the revision adds agentic content, the [MEASURE](#h3-ai-rmf-mapping-by-function) mapping should be re-checked against it.

## Appendix I: Implications for ISO/IEC 42001

**ISO/IEC 42001:2023** specifies an **AI Management System (AIMS)**: a certifiable management-system standard in the ISO tradition, structured as management-system clauses 4 to 10 plus **Annex A**, a normative reference set of **38 controls under nine control objectives, A.2 to A.10**, selected through a **Statement of Applicability (SoA)**.

The relationship differs from every other appendix here, and the difference is the point:

- **NIST frameworks ask whether outcomes are achieved.** Telemetry is evidence.
- **ISO/IEC 42001 asks whether a *management system* exists, operates, and is improved.** Telemetry is evidence *and* the raw material for the monitoring, measurement, analysis and evaluation the standard requires of the system itself.

**42001 is also the only framework here that is certifiable.** That raises the bar on evidentiary quality: an auditor will ask not just whether telemetry exists but whether it is retained, access-controlled, and demonstrably used as an input to management review. That is a records-management property, not a field-selection property, and it is where this document is thinnest.

> **Access caveat.** ISO/IEC 42001 is a paid standard and was not read in full. Control-objective titles below were taken from public summaries; **verify every identifier and title against the purchased standard before relying on this mapping**. Control numbering within each objective (e.g. `A.6.2.8`) is especially error-prone in secondary sources.

### I.1 Annex A mapping

| Annex A objective | Telemetry that evidences it | Coverage |
| :----------- | :----------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------ |
| **A.2 Policies related to AI** | System prompt / instruction config (§5) as the enforced expression of policy; authorization decision record and rule identity (§16) | Partial: §16 evidences policy *in force*, which is stronger than a policy document |
| **A.3 Internal organization** | Creator, oncall, ownership metadata (§14) | Weak: organizational, not telemetric |
| **A.4 Resources for AI systems** | AgBOM and dependency graph (§14); model, tool, memory and knowledge inventory (§§8 to 11, 10); token, compute and storage aggregates (§12) | **Strong**: the AgBOM cluster is an A.4 artifact almost exactly; A.4.2 *Resource documentation* and A.4.5 *System and computing resources* are directly served |
| **A.5 Assessing impacts of AI systems** | [Appendix A](#appendix-a-attack--incident-inventory) attack corpus; [Appendix B](#appendix-b-mapping-to-the-cosai-risk-map-risks--controls) risk mapping; guardrail and refusal rates as realized-impact measures | Partial: supplies the security input to impact assessment, not the assessment |
| **A.6 AI system life cycle** | **Event logs (A.6.2.8) is the direct hit**: §§5 to 16 in their entirety; capability-set change (§14) for change control; verification via evaluation and guardrail records | **Strongest alignment.** 42001 requires event logging without specifying content; this document specifies the content |
| **A.7 Data for AI systems** | Retrieval provenance (§11); memory provenance (§10); input source and trust classification (§6); data classification constraints (§13) | **Strong**: A.7's provenance and quality controls are served by the provenance fields, which exist here for detection reasons and satisfy A.7 as a by-product |
| **A.8 Information for interested parties** | Incident-response evidence (§§5, 9, 13); ATLAS-tagged detections (§6) supporting incident communication | Partial: supplies substance for A.8.4 incident communication; the communication process itself is out of scope |
| **A.9 Use of AI systems** | Autonomy level (§5); task/intent declaration (§12); human approval events (§16); trigger type (§5); surface (§5) | **Strong**: A.9's *intended use* and *responsible use* controls are evidenced by exactly the fields that detect goal drift |
| **A.10 Third-party and customer relationships** | MCP server identity (§9); peer agent card (§12); provider identity (§8); model provenance (§8); delegation chain (§13) | **Strong**: third-party AI dependencies are visible through the tool, MCP, A2A and supply-chain fields |

### I.2 Where this document is thin, and what would fix it

Three of the four weak areas are properly out of scope. The fourth is a genuine gap.

1. **Organizational controls (A.3, parts of A.2, A.8)** are roles, reporting lines and communication processes. Not telemetry. Out of scope, correctly.
2. **Impact assessment (A.5)** is a *process* control. This document supplies inputs; it should not attempt the assessment.
3. **Non-security trustworthiness**, fairness, bias, and societal impact under A.5.4 and A.5.5, is outside this document's remit, as it is for [AI RMF](#h3-ai-rmf-mapping-by-function).
4. **Records management is a real gap.** 42001 clause 7.5 (documented information) and clause 9 (monitoring, measurement, analysis and evaluation; internal audit; management review) require telemetry to be *retained, controlled, and demonstrably used*. This document specifies retention tiers and access control in [Implementation Guidance](#18-implementation-guidance) but does not specify **evidentiary properties**: immutability, defined retention periods per field class, chain of custody, or reviewer access records. §15's **Event Sequence Continuity** is the nearest thing and is SHOULD. **Recommendation:** if CoSAI wants this field set to be usable as certification evidence, the retention guidance should be promoted from prose to a normative table with per-tier retention minimums.

### I.3 What this implies

1. **Position the field set as the content specification for A.6.2.8 (event logs).** 42001 requires event logging across the AI life cycle without saying what to log. This is the clearest single fit between the two documents, and (as with the Cyber AI Profile) it lets an organization satisfy a standard using telemetry it built for detection.
2. **Map to Statement of Applicability granularity.** SoA is where 42001 implementation happens. A mapping at individual-control level (A.6.2.8, A.7.4, A.9.3 …) rather than objective level would let an organization cite specific fields per control. Same recommendation, and same mechanical-but-valuable character, as the CSF subcategory mapping in [H.4](#h4-what-this-implies).
3. **Close the records-management gap** if certification evidence is a goal, see [I.2](#i2-where-this-document-is-thin-and-what-would-fix-it) item 4. This is the one place where a compliance framework surfaces a genuine weakness rather than an out-of-scope boundary.
4. **Reuse, do not re-derive.** ISO/IEC 42001 and NIST AI RMF overlap substantially; organizations frequently run both. The mappings in [Appendix H](#appendix-h-implications-for-nist-ai-rmf-and-nist-csf-incl-the-cyber-ai-profile) and here should share a single underlying field→control table with two views, rather than diverging.

> **The through-line for both appendices.** These frameworks are **consumers** of this telemetry, not designers of it. The document's value to them is that a field set built to catch documented attacks turns out to evidence a large share of what they ask for, and that the evidence carries attack grounding, which is more defensible under audit than a control asserted to exist. The direction of derivation should not reverse: **do not add fields to improve a coverage table.**

## Appendix J: Tiering Rationale

Why each component's **MUST** fields earn that tier, and where the tier boundaries are closest. Ordered to match the [classification summary](#45-classification-summary): §5 through §16.

The rubric is in [§4.2](#42-classification-legend). Two rules recur below. **Attack count alone does not set the tier**: a field cited by five attacks stays SHOULD if all five presuppose an edge modality such as delegation. And **the highest-priority use case governs**: a field whose dominant value is Q or A does not reach MUST however useful it is.

### J.1 Application & Agent Reasoning Core (§5)

Every MUST here is an identifier or execution-context anchor that later sections' detections resolve *through*: ≥3 corpus attacks apiece, no modality precondition, **D and R jointly**. *What ran and where*: Agent Name, Instance ID, Surface (D: off-inventory agents; R: quarantining one instance while siblings run, per `AOC-04`, `AOC-05`). *What else belongs to this incident*: Workflow/Run ID, Session/Turn/Step IDs, Trace Context. *What it did and how it ended*: Action Type (the think→act boundary where `AOC-01` and `AOC-02` did their damage) and Execution Status. *What it was configured to do*: System Prompt, both a config-integrity baseline and the reference against which extraction is detected (`TA-07` succeeds when the response reproduces it). *Who started it*: Trigger Type.

- **The identifiers are a hierarchy, not a bag.** Instance → Run → Session → Turn → Step, threaded by Trace Context. `TA-08` (tool-chaining escalation) and `IR-01` (iterated reframing until a refusal flips) are *within-session, across-turn* patterns invisible at run granularity.
- **Trigger Type is MUST because zero-click is a telemetry category.** `TA-01` starts an entire run from one inbound email with no human in the loop. Surface/App would record "email" for both that and an ordinary request; the autonomous flag is what separates them.
- **Autonomy Level is SHOULD**: the oversight dial for delegated action. The corpus repeatedly shows agents operating *above* their intended autonomy (`AOC-04`, `AOC-01`, `AOC-07`); logging the claimed level is what makes that detectable.
- **Organization / Tenant ID is SHOULD on the modality gate, not the evidence gate.** Five attacks now cite it (`AOC-02`, `AOC-05`, `TA-05`, `TA-01`, `TA-11`), which clears the evidence bar comfortably; what holds it below MUST is that multi-tenant hosting is a deployment modality, and a single-tenant deployment has nothing for the field to describe. **MUST for any multi-tenant deployment.** One caveat bears on the promotion decision: `TA-11` is the corpus's only documented cross-tenant exposure, and [A.1](#a1-real-world-attack-vectors) records that **no attacker was involved**, the boundary failed unaided. It establishes that the failure mode is real without being an *attack* in the sense [§4.2](#42-classification-legend) requires, which is exactly the judgment [open question 12](#open-questions-for-the-working-group) asks the WG to make.

### J.2 Input Handling & Trust Provenance (§6)

The densest evidence in the document: Model Input cited by **7** attacks, Input Trust Classification and Source IP by **5** each, Input Source and Guardrail (Input) Verdict by **4**. All **D-primary**: these are the fields an injection or jailbreak detection actually fires on, with strong secondary R value. None presupposes an unusual modality.

- **Model Input** must cover *all* inputs, not the first user turn: injection arrives via tool outputs (`IR-01`), retrieved content (`IR-03`, `TA-01`, `TA-02`), memory (`IR-02`), or another agent (`AOC-12`).
- **Input Trust Classification** operationalizes the risk map's core agentic control. `AOC-02` disclosed 124 email records because it did not distinguish an owner instruction from a non-owner's; `TA-01` is untrusted email content promoted to instruction.
- **Guardrail (Input) Verdict** is MUST because `TA-01` *defeated* a prompt-injection classifier. A classifier bypass is undetectable if verdicts are never logged.
- **Content Modality & Attachment Identity** is MUST because the corpus's obfuscation attacks are modality attacks, instructions in OCR'd images and base64 blobs (`AOC-12`), ~10 MB attachment floods (`AOC-05`). Text-only capture misses both.
- **ATLAS Technique Tag** is MUST *when a detection fires*. It is derived, not raw; its value is D-portability into ATT&CK-aligned tooling plus A-rollup.
- **Guardrail Modification Record is SHOULD.** No corpus entry turns on an enforcement point rewriting a payload, and inline mutation is an emerging modality. Its value is R and A rather than D. The argument for it remains strong; logging only pre-modification content makes the forensic record *actively wrong*: so it is **MUST wherever enforcement points or redaction pipelines can mutate content**.

### J.3 Output Handling, Egress & Refusals (§7)

Output is where damage becomes irreversible, so these are **D-primary with the shortest time-to-value**. Response (**6**) and LLM Refusal (**7**) are the most-cited fields after Model Input. Output Egress Destination (**5**) converts a detection from *"something bad was generated"* into *"and here is where it went"*: the difference between blocking and reporting.

- **Output Egress Destination** would have caught `TA-01` and `TA-03` *before data left*: both smuggle data into an outbound URL on a trusted-looking domain. It also renders `AOC-03`, `AOC-11`, and `AOC-05` visible.
- **LLM Refusal** is an early-warning tripwire. `IR-01` is iterated reframing until a refusal flips; `AOC-12/13/14` are the mirror image, successful refusals whose telemetry documents attempted attacks even when blocked.
- **Citations** is MUST only for deployments that emit them, which is now the common RAG configuration. A citation is a *trusted* output component (`AML.T0067.000`), so three detections depend on it and none is reachable from response text alone: fabricated citations matching no retrieval, attacker-planted links (`TA-02`, `TA-01`), and suppression visible by comparing retrieved against cited (`IR-03`).
- **Observation / Thought is SHOULD**: high-value forensics for separating a compromised agent from a misconfigured one (`AOC-01`, `AOC-07`), but frequently unavailable from provider APIs and privacy-sensitive.

### J.4 The Model & Model Serving (§8)

Four MUSTs, each ≥3 attacks and each D-primary. Model Name + Version is the supply-chain pivot (*which agents used the compromised model*) and is R-critical for scoping. Token Counts is the cheapest DoS and runaway-loop detector in the document (`AOC-04`'s ~60 k-token relay, `AOC-05`, `TA-10`) and costs nothing to emit. LLM Error fires precisely under adversarial conditions.

- **Inference Parameters** rest on a *denominator* argument rather than a tampering attack: "max-length output" (`TA-04`) and "anomalously large input" (`TA-10`) are the documented detection signatures, and neither is computable without `max_tokens` and the declared context window. They also give decoding configuration the integrity baseline §5 gives the system prompt. Capture per-call, per-request overrides are the attack.
- **Model Provenance / Signing is SHOULD** (supply-chain, ties to model-signing work and ODIS `software_hash`). **Pre-Forward-Pass State** and **Token Malformation** are MAY research-grade signals.
- **Provider / Endpoint Identity is MAY**. It rests on one attack, `AOC-06`, which this document's own mapping calls a governance and availability signal rather than a discrete adversary technique. That makes it Q- and A-dominant; the D concern, model substitution, is carried by Model Name + Version.

### J.5 Tools & External Services (§9)

The highest-value **R** fields in the document and strong D besides. Tool Call I/O (**7**) and Tool Name (**6**) are the richest-evidenced here: without them a compromised agent's actions are invisible, and every destructive case in the corpus is reconstructed from them.

- **Tool Type / Trust Boundary** earns MUST via `AOC-14`, which tried to make the agent bypass the tool API and write to backend storage directly. "API-mediated only" is unenforceable unless telemetry distinguishes the two.
- **Execution Environment / Sandbox** is MUST because `TA-06` is characterized as model-emitted Python executed **unsandboxed**: the isolation posture *is* the finding. Two calls to the same code-execution tool, one containerized and one not, are otherwise the same event.
- **Tool Execution ID** makes *a result with no matching request* a queryable condition, and is the only way to correlate asynchronous tool calls. `AOC-01`'s false completion report is precisely a request/result mismatch.
- **Tool ACL / Required Scope stays SHOULD**: five attacks cite it, but every one presupposes meaningful delegation.
- **Tool Definition Digest is SHOULD, and that reflects a corpus gap rather than a weak field.** No catalogued attack is a tool-definition rug-pull: `TA-12` and `TA-13` are MCP-mediated but neither turns on mutated tool metadata, and CoSAI's MCP Security paper names Tool Poisoning and Full Schema Poisoning as threat classes without supplying a documented instance [[18]](#standards--frameworks). **MUST for deployments consuming third-party or dynamically-discovered tools.**
- **MCP Server Identity & Primitive is SHOULD on the modality gate alone.** The corpus carries three MCP incidents (`TA-11` to `TA-13`), two of which this field cites directly (`TA-12`, `TA-13`) as documented MCP-mediated exploitation, so the evidence gate is cleared. What holds it below MUST is the modality gate, since a deployment running no MCP surface has nothing to record. **MUST wherever MCP is in use**; server name and version are as cheap as Tool Name and should be adopted first. Re-running this tier is [open question 12](#open-questions-for-the-working-group).
- **Tool Privacy Classification is MAY**: DLP and compliance governance metadata, A-dominant, and not modality-gated. Its D value is already carried by Tool ACL/Scope and Output Egress.

### J.6 Memory (§10)

Persistent memory is the one component where an attack **outlives the session that planted it**, which is what earns MUST at comparatively low attack counts: a poisoned item silently shapes every future run, so the detection window is unbounded.

- **MINJA (`IR-02`)** poisons memory using only benign queries, the agent autonomously persists malicious reasoning. **AGENTPOISON (`IR-05`)** uses optimized triggers. Neither is detectable without Memory Write/Read plus **Provenance**.
- **Memory Provenance** is the field that exposes `AOC-10`: a "constitution" stored as an externally editable Gist, later edited to make the agent shut down peers and send unauthorized mail. The signal is *a context-shaping memory item resolving to a mutable, non-owner-controlled source.*
- **Memory Footprint** catches `AOC-05` (ever-growing per-non-owner file → mail-server DoS). At **2** attacks it clears the bar on the "especially useful for D" clause, not on count.
- **Memory Write Rationale is SHOULD**: the analogue of Tool Selection Rationale, and `IR-02` is the case demanding it: the content looks innocuous and the write unremarkable; the tell is the justification the agent gives itself.
- **Declared Memory Configuration is MAY.** The silently-raised-limit scenario is absent from the corpus, and its job (a baseline for Memory Footprint) can be met by hard-coding known limits.

### J.7 Retrieval & Content (RAG) (§11)

Two fields, **5** and **4** attacks, both D-primary. RAG is the document's most-cited injection channel (`TA-01`, `TA-02`, `TA-09`, `IR-03`, `AOC-10` are all retrieval-mediated) and the two answer the halves a detection needs: *what came back*, and *where it came from and when it changed*.

- **Retrieval Event + Source/Provenance** connect "what was retrieved" to "what the model then did." Neither is sufficient alone.
- **Poison-RAG (`IR-03`)** manipulates item *metadata tags* rather than content bodies, which is why the integrity signal must cover metadata. **`TA-09`** plants hidden instructions in wikis and tickets, and recently-modified retrievable documents deserve scrutiny, hence freshness folds into provenance.
- **Declared Knowledge-Source Configuration is MAY**, on the same reasoning as its memory counterpart: a silently altered retrieval config or repointed index is not in the corpus, and `IR-03` poisons metadata, not search configuration.

### J.8 Orchestration, Multi-Agent & Background Execution (§12)

The sharpest tiering judgment in the document, because multi-agent orchestration sits close to the SHOULD boundary by definition. The four MUSTs are the ones whose signal is **protocol-independent**: emittable by any orchestrator, with no A2A stack, delegation model, or agent registry.

- **Inter-Agent Message** is the substrate of cross-agent propagation: `AOC-04` (nine-day mutual-relay loop), `AOC-09` (capability transfer), `AOC-11` (mass broadcast), and `AOC-16`: the positive case, agents sharing risk signals.
- **Background / Scheduled Task** captures the corpus's most striking finding: agents spawning infinite shell loops and cron jobs with **no termination condition**, converting short-lived tasks into permanent infrastructure (`AOC-04`, `AOC-10`). With **Loop / Step-Count** it clears the bar on D value rather than attack count.
- **Task / Intent Declaration is SHOULD**: the goal-drift anchor; `AOC-04` shows agents inventing new goals beyond the requested task.
- **A2A Task Lifecycle and Peer Agent Card are SHOULD.** Their evidence is generic multi-agent incidents, not A2A-protocol incidents, `AOC-04/09/11` predate A2A entirely. Both are **MUST the moment A2A or agent cards are in play**; push-notification configuration in particular registers an attacker-settable egress channel.
- **Protocol Envelope Capture is MAY**: Q-dominant, duplicates interpreted fields, carries raw-content privacy weight, and is not modality-gated.

### J.9 Identity, Delegation & Attribution (§13)

The archetype for the MUST/SHOULD split, and it survived the audit unchanged. Two fields are MUST because they apply to **every** deployment, including the simplest single-agent one.

- **Identities Used** (**7** attacks, tied for most-cited) is the accountability primitive: when an agent resets its own mail server (`AOC-01`), dumps 124 records (`AOC-02`), or mass-mails defamation (`AOC-11`), *which principal, which agent, which tool, which credential* is the first question of any response.
- **Verified vs Displayed Identity** is MUST on a precise D argument rather than volume. `AOC-08` shows same-channel spoofing *detected* (the agent checked an immutable user ID) and cross-channel spoofing *succeeding* where only a display name was available. The difference between those outcomes is entirely a telemetry difference.
- **Everything below is SHOULD by construction, not by weak evidence**: several carry 3 attacks, which on count alone would qualify. Each presupposes **delegated authority**: an originating principal distinct from the caller, a chain of prior hops, monotonically narrowing scopes, cryptographic attestation, or a revocation lifecycle. A deployment without cascaded delegation has nothing for them to describe. The corollary matters as much: a deployment that *does* run cascaded delegation should treat this entire section as mandatory on day one. SHOULD means "not universal," never "defer."
- **Trust-Domain Crossing & Delegation Depth** is the field that makes an **externally-operated** counterparty legible. ODIS treats `trust_domain` and `max_depth` as policy-engine inputs rather than telemetry, which is right only while a chain stays inside one domain. Once authority crosses out of the domain that issued it, or the acting agent sits several hops from the originating principal, both become detection-grade: `AOC-04`'s nine-day relay and `AOC-09`'s capability transfer are both depth phenomena, and `TA-11` is a domain-boundary failure. See [§4.7](#47-agents-you-do-not-operate).
- **Credential Minting & Scope-Narrowing** adds the *event* the surrounding fields only describe the state of. Forwarding a caller's inbound token is usually wrong (it is scoped for the agent, not the backend) so the **requested-vs-granted delta** is what makes a silently over-broad grant visible (`TA-08`).

### J.10 Asset Inventory & Fleet Aggregates (§14)

One MUST in a section otherwise SHOULD and MAY, and the reason is categorical: every other field here describes a **state**, while **Capability-Set Change Event** describes a **transition**, and transitions are where attacks are visible.

- Grounded directly in `AOC-09`, where one agent teaches another to acquire a browser/download capability. The security event is the *acquisition*; the previous inference path ("tool-call spike + new Tool Name") fires only once the capability is exercised, and never at all for one acquired and held in reserve. Removal matters symmetrically: a guardrail tool or logging sink quietly dropped is a defence-evasion signal. It is also cheap where least expected to fire: a static capability set emits nothing.
- **Version and Repository / Software Ref are SHOULD** as supply-chain response primitives. **Version is the closest call here**: 2 attacks and genuine R value (CVE blast radius), held below MUST because that value is realized through a fleet-inventory process rather than per-event detection, and because it is inseparable in practice from the AgBOM cluster. The WG may reasonably promote it.
- **The AgBOM cluster is SHOULD**: it requires an inventory-emission capability most deployments lack. Within it: **Component Dependency Graph** is the complete answer to CVE blast radius, since `TA-06` is a vulnerability in a *framework* beneath the agent and reaching it requires transitive edges; **Inventory Attestation Signature** matters because an inventory a compromised agent can rewrite is worth little, with the limit that a signature proves who asserted the inventory, not that the assertion is true, which is §15's subject.

### J.11 Observability-Plane Integrity (§15)

**This section has no MUST, and the reason is a corpus gap rather than a judgment about value.** No attack in [Appendix A](#appendix-a-attack--incident-inventory) targets the observability plane: not one of the 34 catalogued incidents starves an enforcement point, disables instrumentation, or suppresses events. Every field here is grounded *analogically*: the corpus establishes the capability exists (`TA-10` proves resource pressure against AI infrastructure is achievable; `TA-01` proves the payoff of defeating a classifier) without containing an instance. Under the rubric that is SHOULD, and the section is additionally modality-gated on an inline enforcement architecture.

That absence is itself a finding, and probably a **collection artifact**: attacks on telemetry are under-reported precisely because the telemetry that would reveal them is what was attacked. Two developments narrow the gap without closing it: CoSAI's MCP Security paper names **Invisible Agent Activity** (agents operating covertly while mimicking valid workflows) as an MCP threat class, and the CoSAI Risk Map now carries `riskAuditTrailTampering` with an ATT&CK anchor (*Disable or Modify Tools*, T1685). Neither is a catalogued incident, so neither satisfies the evidence rule, but both establish that the scenario is recognized outside this document. This is the section most likely to be re-tiered upward; see [open question 12](#open-questions-for-the-working-group).

- **Enforcement-Point Availability & Failure Mode** remains the highest-leverage field here, the first to adopt and the first to promote. A verdict that never arrived and a verdict of `allow` are indistinguishable in the log, which makes the control plane a single point of silent failure. Fail-open is often the correct availability posture; it is only acceptable if it is *recorded*.
- **Instrumentation Coverage** resolves the ambiguity undermining every absence-based detection in the document; no refusal, no termination condition, no matching request are each only interpretable if the relevant hook was instrumented.
- **Event Sequence Continuity** is the minimum defence against selective suppression by a compromised agent: sequence numbers make omission visible as a gap rather than invisible as silence.
- **Policy Reason Code is MAY**: A-dominant reporting convenience, not modality-gated, and the underlying decision is already captured by Guardrail Verdict and classified by the ATLAS tag.

### J.12 Policy Enforcement & Mediation (§16)

Two of six are MUST, and both are universal rather than modality-gated.

- **Authorization Decision Record** fills a structural hole the rest of the field set has by construction. The document logged what a *content classifier* concluded (Guardrail Verdict, §§6 to 7) and what authority a tool *requires* (Tool ACL/Scope, §9), but never what the authorization layer **decided**, on which rule, or why, so a denied operation and a never-attempted one were indistinguishable. Four attacks turn on that record: `AOC-02` (non-owner compliance), `AOC-08` (privileged action after spoof), `AOC-10` (injected authority), and `TA-08` (individually-authorized calls escalating in aggregate; visible only if each link's decision and rule are recorded). D and R jointly.
- **Attribute Source / Trusted-Provenance Marking** is the zero-trust principle applied to telemetry itself, and it earns MUST because it determines whether the rest of the schema can be believed. The document already applies the idea once (Verified vs Displayed Identity (§13)) and the generalization is that identity is not the only attribute an agent can assert. Autonomy Level, Task Declaration, System Prompt, and every reasoning field are agent-supplied, and `AOC-01` is the corpus's proof that agents *do* report falsely: it declared a secret deleted while the data remained recoverable. Cost is an enum per attribute group, not per event.
- **Session Taint Labels is SHOULD**, and is a genuinely different mechanism from §6's Input Trust Classification: that classifies a segment of one payload, while taint is **state accumulating across a session** that survives into operations whose own content is clean. That distinction is the whole attack in `TA-01` and `TA-02`, where the exfiltrating request is innocuous in isolation. Of everything in SHOULD this has the highest D value per unit of effort.
- **Human Approval / Elicitation is SHOULD** and covers the control the corpus most often shows *missing*: `AOC-01`, `AOC-07`, and `AOC-11` are all irreversible actions taken without human authorization. **MUST wherever irreversible or high-impact actions are reachable.** Two sub-signals matter: approver identity must come from the identity provider, not the agent's claim; and approval scope must be re-validated against the arguments actually presented, or one sign-off can be replayed against a larger action.
- **Mediation Coverage & Bypass Path is SHOULD**: the enforcement counterpart to §15's Instrumentation Coverage. §15 asks *is the telemetry complete?*; this asks *is the enforcement unbypassable?* `AOC-14` is precisely this attack. A control that can be routed around is not a control.
- **Backend / Route Restriction is SHOULD.** Paired with taint it is a D signal; standing alone it is closer to A (data-residency evidence) and Q.

---

## Attack taxonomy: MITRE ATLAS is canonical

**MITRE ATLAS `AML.Txxxx` is the canonical adversary-technique taxonomy for this field set. The CoSAI `AT10xx` codes are formally deprecated to aliases.**

What that means in practice:

1. **Every technique reference is an ATLAS ID.** Detections, the [Threat Classification / ATLAS Technique Tag](#6-input-handling--trust-provenance) field (§6), compliance rollups, and all attack mappings in [Appendix A](#appendix-a-attack--incident-inventory) use `AML.Txxxx`. Where a technique has a sub-technique that fits, the sub-technique is preferred (`AML.T0051.001` over `AML.T0051`).
2. **`AT10xx` codes are retained for one purpose only**: reading existing CoSAI material. They appear in [Appendix A.4](#a4-attack-taxonomy-cosai-at10xx-codes-deprecated-aliases-to-mitre-atlas) as an alias table and in the `IR-` case-study rows that historically cited them. **New material must not introduce `AT10xx` codes**, and they should not appear in emitted telemetry.
3. **No CoSAI-only technique numbering is maintained going forward.** If a technique has no ATLAS equivalent, the correct response is to propose it upstream to ATLAS, not to mint a local code. Where no anchor currently exists, the mapping records the nearest ATLAS technique and flags the judgment, as [A.5](#a5-attack-inventory--mitre-atlas-technique-mapping) does for `AOC-06`.

**Why.** ATLAS is community-maintained, versioned, and ATT&CK-aligned, so a detection tagged `AML.T0051` correlates with the rest of a SOC's ATT&CK-based tooling without translation. It is already a first-class compliance framework in AITF (`compliance.framework = mitre_atlas`), so the tag has a binding today. And a parallel CoSAI numbering would need its own maintenance, governance, and mapping table for no benefit that ATLAS does not already provide, the alias table in A.4 exists to *retire* that burden, not to institutionalize it.

**Scope of the deprecation.** This decision binds this document. The CoSAI AI-Incident-Response material that originated the `AT10xx` labels is owned by another workstream; the recommendation to that group is to adopt the same position, and [A.4](#a4-attack-taxonomy-cosai-at10xx-codes-deprecated-aliases-to-mitre-atlas) is written to be usable as the migration table if they do.

> **Maintenance obligation.** ATLAS is versioned and periodically adds GenAI and agentic techniques. Every `AML.Txxxx` in [A.4](#a4-attack-taxonomy-cosai-at10xx-codes-deprecated-aliases-to-mitre-atlas) and [A.5](#a5-attack-inventory--mitre-atlas-technique-mapping) must be re-verified against <https://atlas.mitre.org/> at publication and at each revision.

## Open questions for the working group

Each item is a decision the document *takes a position on* but that requires working-group ratification or resolves a cross-standard tension. Ordered by consequence.

1. **OpenTelemetry submission (and the sampling problem).** Does CoSAI file the [Appendix D.3](#d3-what-cosai-asks-opentelemetry-to-include) asks with the OTel GenAI conventions working group, paired with their [E.2](#e2-what-cosai-asks-ocsf-to-include-summary) OCSF counterparts? The conventions are all at *Development* status and have just moved to a dedicated repository, so the window is favourable and closing. Three decisions inside this: (a) whether to seek a **security guardrail signal by extending `gen_ai.evaluation.*`** or by minting a separate namespace, where the former is likelier to be accepted and the latter is cleaner; (b) whether this document should make the [D.5](#d5-context-propagation-sampling--privacy-three-operational-traps) **sampling requirements normative**: that security-relevant events are never head-sampled and that the sampling configuration is itself logged. Default OTel sampling will silently discard most attack evidence, which makes this arguably the highest-impact operational statement in the document, and it currently sits in an appendix rather than in [Implementation Guidance](#18-implementation-guidance); and (c) **the scope of the memory ask ([D.3](#d3-what-cosai-asks-opentelemetry-to-include) item 3).** `gen_ai.memory.*` already exists, carrying store and record identity, query text, record count, seven memory operations and a `gen_ai.memory.client` span, implemented by `aws-bedrock-agentcore` and `google-adk`. What is missing is narrower: **provenance** and **footprint**, neither of which appears anywhere in the `gen_ai` registry. Scoped to two attributes on an existing span, it is the cheapest item in D.3 and follows this appendix's rule to ask OTel for what OTel already models.
2. **OCSF standardization path & ownership.** Does CoSAI formally submit the [Appendix E](#appendix-e-implications-for-ocsf--aitf-the-standardization-bridge) asks (AI Agent Activity (9001), AI Delegation Activity (9002), an `ai_operation` profile with the MUST tier as *required*, the new objects/enums, and ATLAS-on-findings) to OCSF via AITF? If so, what is the phase sequence ([E.3](#e3-incremental-extension-path-via-aitf)) and who owns each submission? This is the bridge's central next action.
3. **Content-capture default.** Should the standard *mandate* hash-first + optional raw + redaction flags as the default representation for all content-bearing fields (Model Input, Response, System Prompt, Memory, Retrieved Content), rather than leaving raw-vs-hash to deployment policy?
4. **Chain-of-thought tier.** A specific case of (3): keep `Observation/Thought` at **SHOULD**, or promote to **MUST-when-available but redaction-gated** given its forensic value in `AOC-01`/`AOC-07`/`IR-02`?
5. **Trust-classification vocabulary.** Ratify the proposed `trust_level` enum (trusted-instruction / trusted-data / untrusted-data / adversarial-suspected) from [Appendix E.2](#e2-what-cosai-asks-ocsf-to-include-summary), or revise it? (Reframed: the doc now proposes this enum, so the open item is ratification, not whether to have one.)
6. **ODIS emission point.** Which delegation/identity fields are emitted as *telemetry* vs only presented to the *policy engine*? This doc proposes emitting the delegation chain + granted authorizations + attestation as telemetry; ODIS §6.4 treats them as policy-engine input. Alignment needed.
7. **Component tagging.** Should events carry an explicit `component_id` (risk-map) tag so the component mapping is machine-checkable for fields that span components (e.g. Identities Used), aligning with the risk-map ontology effort?
8. **Scope boundary for governance signals.** Is provider-policy / availability / governance telemetry in scope for a *detection-and-response* spec, or does it belong to a separate governance/compliance track? `AOC-06` (provider-side silent truncation) maps only awkwardly to an adversary technique (`AML.T0048` External Harms) and is fundamentally a governance/availability signal, not an attack. The WG must decide whether such signals stay first-class here, are delegated to the AITF `compliance.*` / `quality.*` namespaces, or are declared out of scope.
9. **Relationship to OWASP AOS.** Does CoSAI formally position this document as the **requirements layer** to AOS's **exposure layer**, as [Appendix F](#appendix-f-owasp-aos-cross-reference) proposes, with a liaison to submit the [F.5](#f5-what-this-document-contributes-back-to-aos) contributions (trust classification, egress destination, ATLAS tagging, tiering, delegation, observability-plane integrity) upstream? Related and more urgent: **the two documents currently propose different OCSF strategies** ([F.6](#f6-divergences--open-coordination-items) item 1). Aligning before either submits is cheaper than reconciling after.
10. **Is the observability plane itself in scope?** [§15](#15-observability-plane-integrity) asserts that enforcement availability, fail-open behaviour, instrumentation coverage, and event continuity are security telemetry, while the enforcement *protocol* is not. That line is defensible but it is a genuine scope expansion, the document now specifies telemetry about the telemetry system. Ratify, narrow, or reject. A narrower alternative: keep only **Enforcement-Point Availability & Failure Mode** as MUST and move the remaining three fields to a pipeline-integrity annex.
11. **Content-bearing additions and the privacy default.** Three new fields carry content or near-content: **Citations** (URLs and document identity), **Protocol Envelope Capture** (raw payloads), and **Content Modality & Attachment Identity** (filenames and hashes). Open question 3's hash-first default should be resolved for these explicitly; attachment *hashes* are the correlation primitive and are low-risk, but filenames and citation URLs can themselves be sensitive.
12. **Corpus gaps, one of three now closed; re-run the affected tiers.** Fields sat below the tier their reasoning would justify because [Appendix A](#appendix-a-attack--incident-inventory) held **no documented instance** of the attack they detect. `TA-11` to `TA-13` ([Appendix A.1](#a1-real-world-attack-vectors)) change that picture, but unevenly, and the accounting is worth stating precisely because two of the three affected fields are affected differently:

    - **Closed: cross-tenant agent leakage.** `TA-11` is the documented instance. **Organization / Tenant ID** (§5) is now held at SHOULD by the modality gate alone.
    - **Changed but not closed: MCP-mediated exploitation.** `TA-12` and `TA-13` are documented MCP exploitations. That removes the "no MCP attack in the corpus" argument for **MCP Server Identity & Primitive** (§9) without supplying the rug-pull described in the next bullet, which is a distinct gap.
    - **Still open: MCP tool poisoning / definition rug-pull.** A well-documented real-world class absent from the inventory, and now the sole remaining evidentiary argument holding **Tool Definition Digest** (§9) at SHOULD. CoSAI's MCP Security paper names Tool Poisoning and Full Schema Poisoning as threat classes but cites no incident.
    - **Still open: attacks on the observability plane.** Enforcement starvation, instrumentation disablement, event suppression, whose absence leaves §15 with no MUST at all, and which is plausibly a *collection artifact*, since such attacks are under-reported precisely because they disable the telemetry that would reveal them.

    The WG should now decide whether **Organization / Tenant ID**, **MCP Server Identity & Primitive**, and **Tool Definition Digest** move to MUST, noting that the modality gate still applies independently of the evidence gate: a single-tenant, non-MCP deployment gains nothing from any of the three. **A prior question for Organization / Tenant ID:** [A.1](#a1-real-world-attack-vectors) records that `TA-11` involved no attacker, the boundary failed unaided, so it establishes the failure mode without being an *attack* in the sense [§4.2](#42-classification-legend) requires. The WG should say whether a documented non-adversarial exposure satisfies the evidence rule, since the same question will recur. **Recommendation:** task the corpus maintainers with searching deliberately for the two remaining gaps, and re-run the tier assignments. This is a cheaper and better-grounded path to a larger MUST tier than relaxing the evidence rule.
13. **Should the evidence rule admit analogical grounding?** Related to (12) but distinct. Several SHOULD fields are motivated by a *mechanism* the corpus demonstrates, applied to a surface it does not yet cover; resource pressure is proven achievable (`TA-10`), so enforcement-point starvation is plainly feasible even though no one has catalogued it. The document currently requires a **documented instance**, which is conservative and keeps the MUST tier defensible, but systematically lags real-world attack development in a fast-moving area. Options: keep the strict rule; admit analogical grounding at SHOULD only (the current de facto position, now stated explicitly in the [legend](#42-classification-legend)); or create a time-boxed **PROVISIONAL-MUST** for fields with strong mechanism arguments awaiting corpus confirmation.
14. **Adopt the assume-breach premise document-wide?** [Appendix G.1](#g1-the-threat-model-the-most-important-contribution) argues that CPEX's threat model is stronger than the one this document has implicitly used: the agent is not only a target but a potential **liar**, so any self-asserted attribute is untrustworthy. §16's **Attribute Source / Trusted-Provenance Marking** applies that as a cross-cutting MUST. The WG should decide whether to go further and **re-examine every field for self-assertion risk**: several current MUST and SHOULD fields (Autonomy Level, Task/Intent Declaration, System Prompt, all reasoning traces) are agent-supplied, and arguably each should carry an explicit caveat rather than relying on the cross-cutting marker.
15. **Should the document adopt a normalized operation view?** CPEX's Common Message Format lets one policy cover tool calls, A2A, inference, prompts, and resources uniformly. This document organizes by component (§§5 to 14) to match the CoSAI Risk Map, which means the same logical operation is described differently depending on the pipeline that carried it, and cross-protocol detections are awkward to express. Options: keep the component organization; add a normalized operation projection alongside it; or restructure. See [G.5](#g5-divergences--gaps-remaining) item 3.
16. **AgBOM tier and format.** [§14](#14-asset-inventory--fleet-aggregates-mostly-may) places the AgBOM cluster at SHOULD and stays format-agnostic across CycloneDX / SPDX / SWID. Should CoSAI instead **recommend one binding** for interoperability? CycloneDX has the most mature AI/ML component modelling and is the format AOS has drafted first, which argues for it, but a recommendation is a commitment the WG should make deliberately.
