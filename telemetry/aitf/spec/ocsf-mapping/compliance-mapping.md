# AITF Compliance Framework Mapping

AITF automatically maps AI telemetry events to eight regulatory and security frameworks.

## Overview

Every OCSF event produced by AITF is enriched with compliance metadata, mapping the event to relevant controls across multiple frameworks. This enables automated compliance reporting and audit trail generation.
